<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">African families 
  are very social. Families, including neighbors, regularly visit each other (sometimes 
  on a daily basis). Meals are also shared by members of the family and invitation 
  to share a meal is assumed and does not require a formal notification. That 
  means, if you are at someone's house, they expect you to share a meal with them 
  regardless to whether your visit was planned or unplanned. Neighbors who happen 
  to pass-by during a meal time, are automatically invited to eat. One can respectfully 
  decline to eat by first taking a small portion of the meal to honor those who 
  cooked it. Thereafter, it is acceptable to sit and talk to those who are eating 
  or to leave. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In social gatherings 
  like parties at home, female members of the household or relatives of the host 
  serve the guests. Sometimes young men can be asked to help with serving drinks 
  and taking away the dishes after a meal. However, it is women who are expected 
  to cook, serve, and wash dishes. Thus, the responsibility of food gathering, 
  food preparation and distribution is reserved for women and it is considered 
  improper for a man to interfere with those duties. <br>

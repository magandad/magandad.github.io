<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Reciprocal 
Verb<br>
</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reciprocal 
form of the verb expresses a concept of mutuality of interaction. The specific 
meaning depends on the verb with which it is used. The suffix -an- which is added 
to the verb translates to &#145;each other.&#146; We have examples in the text: 
-tembeleana, &#145;visit each other&#146;, <br>
-amkiana &#145;greet each other&#146;. <br>
Personal Object Marker Pronouns<br>
Personal object marker pronouns were discussed in Lesson 2 above. Review this 
section for understanding.<br>
<b><br>
The infinitive form</b><br>
It is formed by adding the prefix ku- to a verb stem as in ku-kaa &#145;to sit&#146;, 
and ku-lea &#145;to raise/take care of children.' Other examples from the text: 
<br>
kutembeleana &#145;to visit each other&#146;<br>
kujifunza &#145;to learn&#146;<br>
kuwaamkia &#145;to greet them&#146;<br>
<br>
The infinitive may also be used to translate as a gerund (verbal noun). This may 
be used as: Kulea watoto ni kazi ya mama . &#145;Raising (to raise) children is 
a mother&#146;s job&#146;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As it is the case 
  in the reading text for this unit, the infinitive may occur after certain verbs. 
  Consider this example from the text. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anaanza kujifunza 
  &#133;&#133;.he/she is beginning to learn&#133;&#133;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  More &lt;clickabes&gt;<br>
  Other verbs with which the infinitive is used include: &#145;like&#146;, &#145;want&#146;, 
  &#145;be able/can&#146;, and &#145;feel.' For example: Ninaanza kusoma &#130;I 
  am starting to read/study&#146; Ninapenda kusoma. &#145;I like to read/study.&#146; 
  Ninataka kusoma. &#145;I want to read.&#146; Ninaweza kusoma. &#145;I can/am 
  able to read.&#146; Ninajisikia kula &#145;I feel like eating (something).&#146; 
  It is also used after the adverbs; baada ya &#145;after&#146;and kabla ya &#145;before&#146; 
  as in: 1. Baada ya kusoma, alilala &#145;After reading, he/she slept.&#146; 
  2. Kabla ya kulala alikula &#130;Before sleeping he/she ate.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Preposition 
  kwa</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There is no specific 
  meaning for kwa. It largely depends on the context. Its general meaning and 
  functions are prepositional. Look at its use in the reading text for this unit.<br>
  Kuamkia kwa heshima. &#130;to greet with respect&#146;.<br>

  In some cases it can be used with a meaning that implies instrument and translates 
  &#145;by&#146; or &#145;with.&#146; It can also be used to mean &#145;on&#146;, 
  &#145;at&#146; &#145;for&#146; and &#145;in&#146; as in: <br>

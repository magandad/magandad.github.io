  <br>
  This is often referred to in some grammars as the perfect tense. The me -tense 
  indicates an action that has been completed and has resulted in the present 
  state of affairs. Consider the following example from the text. <br>
  Babu na wajukuu wake wamevaa kanzu nyeupe.<br>
  &#145;Grandpa and his grandchildren are wearing/dressed in white robes.&#146;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The act of putting 
  on the white robes took place before the described present state (i.e. the act 
  of grandpa and his grandchildren dressing in white robes took place earlier 
  than the moment of speech). The me- tense is often found in descriptions of 
  states of being. For example:<br>
  <br>
  Mtoto amelala &#145;the child is (in a state of ) sleeping&#146;<br>
  Mtoto amesimama &#145;the child is (in a state of ) standing&#146;<br>
  Mtoto amekaa. &#145;the child is (in a state of) sitting.&#146;<br>

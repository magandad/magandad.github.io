<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The role of grandparents 
is very significant in the African cultures. They help raise children and take 
an active role in teaching their grandchildren morals, good behavior, and self-reliance. 
Grandparents have an opportunity to do this because they often spend more time 
with the children while their parents are at work in the city or on the farm. 
Grandparents use the wisdom acquired through a long experience of raising children 
to provide a nurturing atmosphere which help shape the lives of the young ones. 
Grandparents consider it their responsibility to make a difference in their grandchildren&#146;s 
lives. Often times they try to compensate for the mistakes they may have made 
in raising their sons and daughters, the parents of their grandchildren. Grandparents 
teach their grandchildren the history of their community and family. Often times, 
the teaching is done in the form of oral stories. </font>

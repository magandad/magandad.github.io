  </font></b><br>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Terms of reference 
  reflect one's family status. In the reading texts mothers and fathers are referred 
  to by the name of one of their offspring, their first born child. For example: 
  <i> <b>mama Hadija, baba Hadija</b></i>. In some families, the first born male 
  may be selcted as the term of reference irrespective of the fact that he may 
  have older female siblings. Thus, <i><b>Mama</b></i> and <i><b>baba of Hadija 
  </b></i>would be referred to as <i><b>baba na mama Hidarusi</b></i> since he 
  is the first born male. Grandparents and older folk are referred to as <i><b>babu 
  /mzee</b></i> for males and <i><b>bibi</b></i> for women. Siblings show respect 
  to each other, with the youngest referring to their older brother as kaka so 
  and so and their older sister dada so and so. Aunts and uncles are also referred 
  to as uncle or aunt so and so, never by their first or last name only. For example: 
  <i> <b>shangazi Hadija</b></i> 'aunt Hadija' and <i><b>mjomba Ahmedi</b></i> 
  'uncle Ahmedi.' Children refer to the parents of their friends as <i><b>baba 
  </b></i>so and so or mama so and so (e.g. <i><b>baba Hadija/mama Hadija</b></i>), 
  never by their own first or last names. Friends of the father and mother may 
  be given the honorary title of uncle or aunt. </font></p>

  <br>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>term relationship</b><br>
  baba 'father'<br>
  baba mdogo 'one's father's younger brother'<br>
  baba mkubwa 'one's father's older brother'<br>
  ami 'one's father's younger or older brother'<br>
  mama 'mother'<br>
  mama mdogo 'one's mother's younger sister'<br>
  mama mkubwa 'one's mother's older sister'<br>
  shangazi 'one's father's sister'<br>
  mjomba 'one's mother's brother (uncle)'<br>
  binamu 'cousin'<br>
  mpwa 'niece or nephew'<br>
  mkaza mjomba 'one's uncle's wife'<br>

  Both family members on the father and mother's side are very important. They 
  form the first group of immediate members of the extended family. They assume 
  responsibilities of the father and mother if they are unable to raise or care 
  for the children. To uncles and aunts (in the English sense which includes brothers 
  and sisters of both the father and mother), the children of a brother or a sister 
  are no less than their own. This close relationship makes the term cousin restricted. 
  That is, the children of the brother of one's father are brothers and sisters 
  to each other and are rarely referred to as cousins. However, one's aunt's children 
  can be referred to by the term <b><i>binamu</i></b> 'cousin.' Mostly coastal 
  speakers to refer to the brother of one's father also use the term ami.</font></p>

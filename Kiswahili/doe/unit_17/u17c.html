<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Unit 17 <span
class=SpellE>Utalii</span> </span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Tourism is one of <st1:place
w:st="on">East Africa</st1:place>'s economic assets. It draws thousands of
visitors from all over the world every year. They visit many points of interest
such as the wildlife parks, cultural museums, and local villages and
communities. They are very much attracted to the local cultures and traditions
that are exemplified through songs, dance, fashions, arts and crafts, ways of
life, and cuisines. Most famous are historical sites including preserved ruins
of ancient autocracies and foreign occupations. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Visitors can also enjoy
the clean sand beaches along the coast, the tourist hotels and facilities, and
shopping at both the local markets and shops. They quickly learn about the art
of bargaining and how to search for rare souvenirs at the market, shops, and
from petty vendors. There are two important cultural aspects to note. One, the
term <span class=SpellE><i>duka</i></span> 'shop' has an extended meaning which
implies 'variety store.' In a <span class=SpellE>duka</span>, one may find as
few as three different types of goods or as many as twenty types in display.
These may include: clothing, hair products, shoes, food items, perfume,
deodorants, toiletries and decorations. This is generally more typical in rural
or suburbia shops. In the city, many shops specialize in one or two products. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If you want to buy an
item from the shop, you have to ask the vendor to show it to you. If you like
it, you pay for it in cash. If the item is clothing, you must know the exact
size because the item cannot be tried or returned for exchange or a refund. The
only items that can be tried at the shop are shoes and hats. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Not all items of clothing
are bought ready made. To make a dress, one can buy the material from a fabrics
dealer. Fabrics can be bought from a shop or from an outdoor fabrics market.
Although the price of an item may be displayed, it is not fixed. The seller and
the buyer can bargain for the best price. </span></p>

<p><st1:place w:st="on"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Mount
 Kilimanjaro</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>
is another point of interest. It attracts many people, old and young, men and
women, who want to climb to its highest point, the Gillman's Point. Not only do
they learn the local conditions associated with the mountain but also adapt to
the culture, learn from their guides and porters about the diverse social and
cultural values of the communities living around the mountain. The guides and
porters also learn from the visitors. As such, these encounters are beneficial
to the visitors and the local people, a perfect way of learning, informally,
about each others cultures and traditions. Another avenue for visitors to learn
about the local cultures is places of socialization. <br style='mso-special-character:
line-break'>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Group socialization is an
important aspect of the culture. Men always go together for a drink and or a
social gathering after work. Rarely would such gatherings include women.
Because children are a woman's primary responsibility, working women try to
spend as much time at home as possible when not at work. Men gatherings serve
the purpose of a venue for discussing politics, business and social issues and
networking, which reinforce male bonding. Women have social gatherings at each
other's home where they can socialize and attend to their family obligations.
Occasionally women may go to a public social place with their spouses or
friend(s). Unlike men, a woman rarely goes to a public or social place like a
bar or a restaurant unaccompanied. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Visitors would also learn
that when invited to a restaurant for a meal or to a bar for a drink, the
culture is such that the invitee pays for the meal or drinks. Thus, if someone
says, 'lets go to dinner' or 'let's do dinner', it means they are offering to take
you out to dinner and pay for it and any drinks consumed. An invitation to go
out to eat is considered equivalent to an invitation to somebody's home for a
meal and socialization. The affect of venue does not change the etiquette or
the presupposed host. Likewise, if a group decides to sit together for a drink,
each member is expected to buy a round of drinks. This socialization
requirement can be costly and can force one to drink more than they intend to.
It may be difficult for one to opt to take only one drink in such a gathering.
This social etiquette can also be found in the English culture (in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>), the assumed source of this cultural
etiquette in <st1:place w:st="on">East Africa</st1:place>. Lastly, when invited
to someone's house the guest is not expected to take anything (such as wine,
food, flowers, etc.) with them. The host would think that the guest was worried
he/she will not have enough to eat/drink. Thus, some of the western etiquettes
might appear offensive to a host in this and many other African cultures. </span></p>

  Note: Greetings</font></b></font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings are 
  a very important part of the culture of the African people. Likewise, Swahili 
  speakers take greetings very seriously. People take time to greet others even 
  if they are strangers. This cultural habit is more visible in the rural areas 
  than in the city where the pressure to greet others as a cultural norm is minimal. 
  However, when friends and acquaintances meet, they generally stop and exchange 
  an extended greeting ritual. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The general greeting 
  that can be used by anyone is ---<i>jambo</i> and <i>habari gani</i>. When one 
  says <i>hujambo</i>/<i>hamjambo</i> or <i>habari gani</i>, the respondent is 
  expected to affirm rather than respond to the contrary. In other words, one 
  does not say for example I am not well as their initial response to <i>hujambo</i>. 
  The proper way is to say I am fine and after a few exchanges bring up any unpleasant 
  news. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The length of 
  a greeting exchange depends on the level of familiarity between the parties 
  concerned. Thus it may take between a minute and longer. Even when people are 
  in a hurry, they will take time to exchange greetings in a proper fashion. Most 
  men would shake hands when greeting one another. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When greeting 
  each other, people may <b>SHAKE HANDS</b> Men more than women will initiate 
  a greeting especially a handshake. Also when men shake each other s hands they 
  use both hands, women tend to use only one hand when greeting men. Women rarely 
  greet each other with a hand shake. Rather they may use body language such as 
  a nodding of the head or a raising of the eyebrows. Influences from other cultures 
  have also been introduced into greetings, especially in the case of women, a 
  hug, a kiss on both cheeks, and holding each other's hands while conversing.</font>

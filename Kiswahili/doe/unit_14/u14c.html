<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Unit 14 <span
class=SpellE>Mapishi</span> </span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Cooking can be viewed as
a hobby, a job, or a recreational activity. In the African culture, it is often
viewed as a responsibility and as a recreational activity. The video clips, the
narratives, and the text in this unit reinforce that view. When cooking, women
talk, tell each other <span class=GramE>stories</span>, council each other, as
well as teach younger females the art of cooking. The socialization aspect of
cooking is important to the women of the house. The team work spirit reinforces
unity in other aspects of their lives. It is also a way of assuring each other
that as a team they can achieve more than when they act individually. <br>
<br>
Many African women living abroad make use of this aspect of socialization. If,
for example, there is a party or a gathering where food is served, women will
automatically offer to help the host with the serving and washing up
afterwards. While they are doing so, they talk to each other, tell stories, or
gossips. Those who do not understand this culture often wonder why the women
would suddenly move to the kitchen or another available space for a
gender-based socialization. For both men and women, the need to have a
single-gender grouping at a social gathering is a natural progression expected
at one point or another during an event. A mother's role is very visible in the
home. She oversees and manages all the activities of the home. She provides
instruction and direction to her family. She complements the role taken and has
control over the planning of meals and deciding appropriate meal times. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This unit brings to light
the culture of foods, food preparations and family meal time. Cooking is as
much a social event as the eating of the meal. For many families, there is a
flexible, but stated meal time at which all members of the family are expected
to be present. In general, families will serve a meal when most family members
are present. The set up and the manner in which the meal is shared follows from
specific family traditions and general cultural norms of the community. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the case of the family
from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zanzibar</st1:place></st1:City>,
the evening meal is light and it consists of different types of breads and
fish. They drink tea made by boiling water, milk and tea leaves together. Their
evening meal is light because their main meal is lunch. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Many families may have
their main meal in late afternoon, when they return from work (between 3 p.m.
and 4 p.m.). As such, they may have a cup of tea before they go to bed and a
small snack. For those that do not get home from work until after six o'clock
their dinner will be the main meal of the day and may consist of most of the
foods seen on the video clip. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Needless to say, there
are no strict rules or schedules. Families will do what is most convenient for
them but family traditions tend to be the hallmark of each family and
contribute to the rich culture surrounding food preparation and food sharing.</span></p>

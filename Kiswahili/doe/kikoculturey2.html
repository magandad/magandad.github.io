    7: The Educational System</b><br>
    <br>
    School is a major part of the Swahili community development. Thus, a lot of 
    emphasis is placed on elementary education that is considered a right for 
    all the children. This, different institutions are engaged in the business 
    of education. There are schools (for example Muslim schools and Christian 
    schools) that are run by religious organizations. These have religious classes 
    as central to the curriculum. Both Government and Muslim schools are usually 
    free of tuition or have a nominal fee that can be used for field trips and 
    extra curricular activities at school. Generally, Christian or other private 
    schools charge a fee that support both academic and non-academic programs 
    that are deemed necessary by the school.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For the 
    most part, many of the teachers at the elementary schools are women. In some 
    cases, the principal or the mathematics/science teachers are male. The explanation 
    we were given for preferring female teachers at the Muslim pre-school that 
    is featured in the video, was that at this stage of their lives, children 
    need a mother figure to facilitate the transition from being at home and being 
    at school, an unfamiliar environment with strangers. However, the choice of 
    a male principal or math science teacher at the elementary school level is 
    not so easy to justify and may be seen as a gender bias issue. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In Tanzania, 
    elementary school covers K-7. There are national exams for fourth graders 
    and seven graders. Only those who pass these exams are promoted to the next 
    level (5<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> grade respectively, there is no 8<sup>th</sup> 
    grade). Fourth graders who do not pass the exam are allowed to repeat the 
    same grade. However, those who do not pass the 7<sup>th</sup> grade exam have 
    to seek alternative ways to advance themselves that may include vocational 
    schools or apprenticeships to develop technical skills. Those who are fortunate 
    to pass the seventh grade exam are required to take another exam when they 
    reach the 10<sup>th</sup> grade and then the 12<sup>th</sup> grade. While 
    passing the 10<sup>th</sup> grade guarantees a student completion of his/her 
    secondary school (junior high), those who pass the 12<sup>th</sup> grade continue 
    on to two more years of high school and opens up a chance to go the university 
    if they pass another terminal exam. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There are 
    both public and private post-secondary institutions (universities, colleges, 
    and vocational training centers). The numbers seem to be growing as the need 
    and demand for higher education intensifies. A number of institutions that 
    teach technology skills have grown over the last couple of years and these 
    have opened up opportunities to young people who would otherwise be unable 
    to continue with post-secondary education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Thus, education is no longer a privilege of a few but a necessary tool 
    for a rapidly changing world. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another 
    point of cultural interest is the importance of wearing uniforms. All primary 
    and secondary schools, whether of government, religious, or private nature, 
    require that the students wear uniforms at school. In most cases, vocational 
    schools also require uniforms. Uniforms bring uniformity among the students 
    and thereby creating an environment that promotes a sense of equality and 
    eliminates possible competition among students due to the class or economic 
    status of their families. The end result is that students are less conscious 
    of their appearance and devote their time to the development of their academic 
    skills without the influence of their social class or status.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><a name="unit8"></a>Unit 
    8:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Geographical location<o:p></o:p></b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Geography provides a natural distinction between cultures. 
    The culture of a Swahili speaker can be influenced by their geographical location. 
    The culture of the Swahili speakers of the coast is greatly influenced by 
    Islamic culture. As such, weddings, burial services, and naming practices 
    may have cultural aspects associated with the Islamic religion. On the mainland, 
    the culture of the Swahili speakers may be influenced by the culture of associated 
    ethnic groups. For example, a wedding include Taarab music, traditional dances 
    of a particular ethnic group, an assortment of foods from both coastal and 
    mainland cultures. It is not, for example, uncommon to find a traditional 
    wedding cake that is a whole roasted goat at a wedding in addition to a three 
    or four tiered flour cake. It is also possible to find both locally brewed 
    beer in addition to commercially brewed beer and other hard liquors. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The mixing 
    of cultures is also clearly demonstrated in places where people eat. For example 
    one can find foods like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ugali</i> (a 
    maize flour dish), <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pilau</i> (rice pilaf), 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mtori</i>, (green banana soup), <i>matoke</i> 
    (boiled green bananas/plantains), <i>wali</i> (boiled rice), <i>biriani</i>, 
    <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kuku/ng’ombe masala</i> (chicken/beef masala), 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>samusa</i> (samosa), <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chapati</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>vitumbua</i> (rice cakes), <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mihogo</i> 
    (cassava/yucca), and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maandazi</i> (donuts) 
    in any restaurant on the mainland or on the island. The only difference may 
    be in ‘finesse’ with the mainland showing a special expertise in those dishes 
    that are common in the homes of the mainlanders. Likewise, restaurants on 
    the coast bear out food preparation expertise that is particular to the costal 
    people. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><a name="unit9"></a>Unit 
    9:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The transportation system<o:p></o:p></b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The mode of transportation in the three East African countries: 
    In Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda reflects a strong influence from Britain, their 
    former colonial power. It is unlikely that these three countries will change 
    from driving on the right to driving on the left, a practice that some of 
    the former British colonies like Nigeria, have already abandoned. Colonial 
    legacy is also reflected in the status quo shown in the choice of mode of 
    transportation, both within the urban areas and from the rural areas to the 
    urban areas. In each of these countries, mass transit is largely by road and 
    where necessary, by water. People travel from the rural areas to the urban 
    areas, and vice versa, by bus and occasionally in small private cars.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the cities, people 
    go to work by bus or by personal cars, motorcycles, or bicycles.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If they live close to work, they can walk. 
    In Zanzibar, for example, many people walk to visit relatives and friends, 
    to go to weddings and other festivals or to recreational parks. Kids who live 
    in the Zanzibar city, walk to and from school. The same is true for many rural 
    kids on the mainland. Some of the kids in the cities of mainland Tanzania 
    can walk to school, but for the most part they take public transportation 
    or take designated school buses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One 
    can also see extensive use of bicycles on the island of Zanzibar but restricted 
    to men. On the mainland, especially in the rural areas, particularly in the 
    central part of Tanzania that have limited or no public transportation like 
    buses or trucks make extensive use of bicycles. In these areas, both men and 
    women ride bicycles but in general one would see more men than women riding 
    bicycles and more walking to and from the farm, market, medical centers, or 
    other social gatherings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Although there are trains, the infra-structure is in the 
    process of rehabilitation to promote efficiency and safety. Where trains are 
    used on a regular basis, the status of the traveler is often defined by the 
    choice and assignments on the train. For example, government officials as 
    well as business men and women would travel in either first or second class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Recreational activities<o:p></o:p></b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Recreational activities define a people’s culture. As the 
    texts show, there are three main recreational activities: sports, dance, and 
    food. These three aspects occupy a very important part of the speakers’ culture 
    by showing how they differ from other nations of the world. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>There are four main sports that identify the Swahili speakers: 
    soccer (for men), netball (for women), basketball, and volleyball (for both 
    men and women).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soccer is a sport 
    that is watched by all people, young and old, men and women, and from all 
    walks of life. Not only is the sport of national importance, but also one 
    that shows great importance in both rural and urban areas. It is a sport that 
    is taken seriously by schools and each year there are local, regional, and 
    national competitions among schools. Locally, however, it is referred to as 
    ‘football’, which means something different in America. Of equal importance 
    is netball that is played exclusively by women. Local, regional, and national 
    competitions are also held every year and among teams drawn from the three 
    East African countries. It is not very well known internationally and it is 
    unlikely that it will ever gain the prestige that soccer enjoys around the 
    world.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Traditional dances are also a mark of the culture. There 
    are local and national groups that perform at different occasions especially 
    during local, regional, and national festivals. Some national groups travel 
    internationally on invitation, but mostly to European and Asian countries.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Because the Swahili people are very social, the culture of 
    food as part of recreation is evident anywhere one goes. Food and drinks are 
    used to get people together whether there is a celebration or not. Any gathering 
    can be turned to a party when food and drinks are introduced. It is not uncommon 
    to find impromptu party-like gathering at someone’s home, at a park, or a 
    restaurant. Needless to say, the Swahili people do not have the habit of eating 
    in restaurants. Many prefer home settings although most men do go out in groups 
    to bars and restaurants to drink. Women rarely go out as much as the men do. 
    They may do so in special occasions. In most cases, affluent families go out 
    together on weekends, particularly on Sundays.</p>

    </o:p></b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There are various activities that can 
    provide sustenance. In many of the Swahili speaking areas, 95% of the people 
    are engaged in farming activities. The type of crops depends on the seasons. 
    For the most part, farmers are fully engaged all year round working on both 
    cash and food crops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the rural 
    areas, it is not rare to find mixed farming. Those whose main occupation is 
    farming would also spend about 5-10% of their time on herding small numbers 
    of cattle such as cows, goats, and pigs (pigs for non Muslim areas only). 
    Those who engage in herding may or may not engage in farming. However, it 
    is not uncommon to find small vegetable gardens near the home for home consumption 
    only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Other activities include arts and crafts. 
    Because of the availability of wood, wood products dominate the carving activities. 
    The products can be sold locally or can be sent to the city for higher prices 
    when sold to tourists. Mostly men engage in carving activities while women 
    concentrate on weaving or sewing. They can weave baskets and mats from palm 
    leaves or other types of plant fibers. Sewing includes decorative crafts for 
    home use or outfits that are worn in special occasions like weddings, and 
    national festivals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    an office, construction, teaching, medical services, and other social services 
    that are also typical in other parts of the world. These have specific work 
    hours, usually 7:30 a.m. through 3:00 p.m. Many government offices are closed 
    on Saturday and Sundays and allow Muslims to take time off on Fridays for 
    religious services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>It is important to note that modern medicine and traditional 
    medicine work hand-in-hand and that both are embodied in the culture of healing. 
    Although there is a strong belief on herbal medicine and the use of traditional 
    healing practices, the tendency is to try modern medicine first until the 
    patient and his/her doctor are convinced that traditional medicine should 
    be given a chance. Thus, there is great respect for traditional herbalists 
    and medicine. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>One should not confuse traditional medicine with witchcraft 
    that does not heal but rather harm. Oftentimes, foreigners see herbalists 
    as witchcraft. This is, unfortunately, a consequence of colonialism that is 
    also largely responsible for the loss of indigenous knowledge about herbal 
    medicine. For centuries, herbal medicine was used to both cure and prevent 
    many indigenous diseases. Nowadays, many modern medical centers and hospitals 
    are looking at ways to revive that knowledge. Many referral hospitals in Tanzania, 
    for example, have a unit at the hospital that focuses on the research on herbal 
    medicine. Some herbalists work very closely with modern doctors at these hospitals 
    and the hospitals allow herbal medicine to be used in conjunction or in place 
    of modern medicine.</p>

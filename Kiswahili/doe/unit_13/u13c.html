<div class=Section1>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Unit 13 Denture <span class=SpellE>za</span>
<span class=SpellE>Arusi</span></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The Swahili culture of
weddings, as espoused by the speakers of the Islamic religion shows interesting
variations. As shown in the video for this unit shows characteristics that
distinguish one cultural setting from another. What is similar in all cultures
is the emphasis of family and friends who have to be invited. There are many
festivities some of which are gender specific and restrictive. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the Islamic religion,
there are important cultural aspects of weddings that are revered. Gender
specific celebrations are evident. For example, men hold a gathering in the
mosque where they share a meal with the groom. Specific cultural etiquettes
such as the manner in which the men sit, wash hands before and after eating,
and share the meal from a big tray. Sharing a meal is a sign of solidarity in
the community, and in this case it is an indication of encouragement for the
groom (video in lesson 1) and social support for his family. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As the video clips and
the reading texts show, the wedding may be <span class=GramE>officiated</span>
at a mosque, church, the brides family home, or at a federal office by an
authorized person, generally a high-ranking government official. The ceremony
can also take place inside outside the house or building. Generally, the
ceremony in a Muslim <span class=GramE>wedding,</span> does not include the
bride. She remains excluded in many of the functions, even the party at which
she is congratulate and given wedding gifts. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In any wedding
celebration, the bride is always the center of attention. Family, friends and
invited guests focus their attention on the bride. They are usually curious
about how well the bride looks, her wedding attire, makeup and the whole
presentation. This is also true about many African cultures regardless of
whether the wedding has traditional or non-traditional features. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The process of adorning
the bride with henna is mostly in the culture of the Swahili speaking peoples
(video in lesson 2). Usually the process is part of the celebrations and may
take two or more days. A lot of the rituals (such as bathing and putting
perfume on the bride) are private and not open to the public. However, hair
dressing and body decorations with henna can be done in public and family and
friends may be invited to watch and offer beauty and makeup suggestions.
Members of the family partake of the ritual by applying henna decorations on
different parts of their bodies too, in particular the arms, legs, feet, palms
of the hands and feet. The designs on the bride and other members of the family
may look identical and are generally a center of attraction at various wedding
parties. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Depending on the culture,
there may be multiple celebrations where attendance is restricted along gender
lines. In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zanzibar</st1:place></st1:City>
(video in <span class=GramE>lesson<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>3</span>),
for example, women do not attend the men's party that, often times, take place
in a mosque. Like wise, men do not attend the women's party unless they are in
the dance group or are invited for special party services like keeping order
and providing a secured environment for the party. This is also true of the
people of mainland <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tanzania</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Women hold what is known as kitchen party, a time where women give the bride
advice and shower her with gifts of items that are useful for kitchen use.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the case of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zanzibar</st1:place></st1:City>, the women's
party is usually different from the men's party in that it is at the home of
the bride's parents; it involves dance troops from both sides of the family, a
variety of food dishes, and gifts for the bride. In addition, the bride does
not appear in public at <span class=GramE>these</span> celebrations; rather,
she is represented by her patron who receives the gifts on her behalf. The
bride's wedding party may last for several hours, most of which are spent in
dancing, singing, gift giving and receiving, and finally sharing some of the
snacks brought for the occasion. Unlike the men's party, a full meal is not
shared by all the party attendees. The food brought by the family members of
the groom is intended for the family of the bride only, not for friends and
invited guests. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The party for the bride
is only one of the various wedding celebration activities which may continue
for several days. At the end of the celebrations (sometimes a week), the bride
is escorted to her husbands home by members of her family and friends. Often,
there is a lot of singing and dancing on the way to the groom's home. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Both the groom's party
and the bride's party may take place at home or a rented reception hall, before
or after the wedding ceremony. The setup as well as the order of related events
depends on the desires of the two families. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There is also a tradition
of bride presentation, a special ceremony where the bride is officially handed
over to the family of the groom. This tradition is comparable to western
tradition where the bride's father walks her down the isle to her future
husband. In the Swahili culture the same ceremony takes place a few days before
the church or court wedding (video in lesson 4). The ceremony is called 'bridal
send-off party or 'bridal farewell party'. In the case of the tradition
described here only uncles and aunts from both sides of the family are
involved. Parents take a low profile during this time while other relatives
assume most of the responsibilities in the preparation of the main activities
associated with the wedding. On the groom's side a similar role is assumed by a
paternal uncle or aunt. They come to the send-off party to receive the
bride-to-be. They will also be the ones who will hand her over to the groom on
the actual wedding ceremony in church or elsewhere. <br>
<br>
Until recently, the groom did not attend the send-off party. This is a new
development in the tradition. It is unclear what the new development means, but
it seems that the two families participate fully in all of the celebrations.
Consequently, the separate gatherings symbolize two wedding festivities, one at
the bride's home and another at the groom's home. If the venues are separated
by distance which requires much traveling, the send-off party allows the bride
and groom to be with family and friends who would not be able to attend the
wedding. At both parties, family and friends may give their gifts to the bride
and groom.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The celebrations show a
combination of long held traditions which have greatly been influenced by
western values and traditions. The tradition of having a party whose purpose if
to gather family and friends of family to bid the bride farewell can be found
in any community in <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>. Traditionally, the
party was attended by women only and lasted for at least a week. Friends of the
bride came to her home, cooked, ate, sang and danced. Adults who could appear
at the party included the bride's aunts and grandmothers. The adults took the
responsibility of providing the bride-to-be with information that is considered
crucial for her new life with her husband and members of his family. They also
used this time to adorn the bride for the wedding day, prepare her wedding
dress, jewelry, body decorations and make-up. This tradition was abolished when
missionaries arrived to spread Christianity.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Presently, a farewell
party lasts for a few hours and may cost a lot of money depending on the wealth
of the family and the number and type of invited friends and guests. The party
is a mixture of traditional customs, inter-ethnic customs, as well as western
customs. This can be seen in issues of hospitality, interaction formalities,
music, and form of dress, language use (ethnic, Swahili and English), types of
food and drink, and the manner in which guests are served and entertained. How
affluent a family influences the formality and extent of the festivities and westernization
of the <span class=GramE>activities.</span> Despite the fact that the family
depicted on the video is very affluent, a lot of the traditional values seem to
be kept. It appears that a fair balance is maintained between the various
customs available to them. For example, there are representatives from the
groom's family at the party. They are invited in order for them to assume the
guardianship of the bride-to-be until the day of the wedding. They will present
her to her in-laws who do not, as a rule, attend the send-off-party. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Although the bride's
parents can come to the party, they play an insignificant role in the rituals
of the 'giving the bride away.' Major roles are played by the bride's aunt
(mother's sister) and uncle (father's brother). Another traditional feature is
the party cake which is a whole roasted goat instead of a baked flour cake that
comes from the western culture. Other adopted customs and traditions include
songs, dances, drinks, food types, the idea of a cake, the idea of toasting the
bride with <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Champagne</st1:place></st1:State>
and gift giving. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Because of the change in
the traditions of this farewell party, the inclusion of non-family members,
male and female makes it possible for the groom to show up too. He is allowed
to sit with his bride, but most of the activities do not involve him except
where both he and his future bride are asked to sit on stools to receive advice
from an elder. The advice is on how to lead a successful married life. The
groom is not allowed to share the farewell cake nor dance with the bride at her
farewell party. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The cost of both the
send-off party and the wedding is borne by the bride&#8217;s relatives and
friends who contribute as much as they are able to. This means that
preparations for the events take many months of fundraising. In many cases the
bride and the groom will receive contributions from co-workers. To ensure this
support and to foster this cooperation, some work places encourage their
workers to contribute to a fund (generally know as <span class=SpellE><i>mfuko</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>wa</span></span> <span class=SpellE>dharura</span></i>
emergency fund) from which they can draw financial support whenever needed.
This kind of cooperation among co-workers is also evident in other times of
hardships like a death in one's family. This mirrors the cultural support and
hospitality expected among the peoples of <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The culture of celebrations
has been enriched by the incorporation of other cultures from within and from
without. The tradition of slaughtering an animal for a feast is one that is
practiced by all ethnic groups. The selection of a goat has nothing to do with
the wedding celebrations. It has becomes a convenient way of symbolizing that
wide held tradition. It is also a cheap and easy way to get enough meat for a
small group of people, since the price of a goat is much lower compared to that
of a cow or a sheep. Rich families would, in this occasion, slaughter a cow for
additional meat, especially if the guest list is high. The presentation of a
whole roasted goat is only a mere gesture from the host, an invitation as well
as an appreciation for the guests in attendance. This appreciation follows from
the fact that an occasion such as this is very highly revered in the community.
It is widely believed that there are three important days in one's life; the
day an individual is born, the day they get married, and the day they die. In
this respect, the extent to which the celebrations are carried out reflects the
reverence accorded to the celebration of life. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The process of cutting
the traditional cake follows from the western tradition, the source of the idea
of a wedding cake. Interestingly, this tradition is now widely practiced by
many affluent families and is occasionally extended to other celebrations like
birthdays and other children's religious events (first <span class=GramE>holy
communion</span> or confirmation). </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other western traditions
fully incorporated in many festivities like these, include extending well
wishes to the bride-to be by offering a toast using wine or champagne. Another
tradition is the western style dance, used as an opening dance by the couple,
and a subsequent invitation to all guests to dance. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In these celebrations the
mixing of cultures is apparent. The groom and his entourage are usually dressed
in western attire. The whole idea of a flower girl and a ring boy is also
foreign. The women, however, are dressed alike, wearing mostly traditional
attires. Typically, women form either side of the family would dress alike for
such an occasion and may choose to dress in western or traditional attire.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The church service as
shown on the video clip (video in lesson 5) has many western characteristics
except for the songs that are in Kiswahili. The bride and groom are dressed in
western outfits and have a flower girl, ring-boy, bride's maids, best-man and
matron-of-honor, all of whom are dressed in western wedding attire. Many of the
family members and friends are also dressed in western dress except the women.
Some have traditional outfits while others have a mixture <span class=GramE>of
the two cultural attire</span>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There is also a mixture
of local and western customs in the church service. These include the exchange
of rings and the signing of the marriage certificate. What is different is that
the signing of the certificate takes place in the church in front of everyone
present. The procession in and out of church is also western based, but the
ululation from relatives, and the throwing of rice instead of flowers to the
couple, is proto-typical and relatively non-western. The wedding party (video
in lesson 6), like the church service, shows a mixture of both traditional and
international features. Two striking customs noticeable at the party include the
western dance, the refreshments served, and the toasting of the bride and groom
with champagne. The traditional features include dances, the wedding cake which
is a roasted whole goat, and the local cuisine. </span></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Swahili culture 
  of weddings, as espoused by the speakers of the Islamic religion shows interesting 
  variations. As shown in the video for this unit shows characteristics that distinguish 
  one cultural setting from another. What is similar in all cultures is the emphasis 
  of family and friends who have to be invited. There are many festivities some 
  of which are gender specific and restrictive. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Islamic 
  religion, there are important cultural aspects of weddings that are revered. 
  Gender specific celebrations are evident. For example, men hold a gathering 
  in the mosque where they share a meal with the groom. Specific cultural etiquettes 
  such the manner in which the men sit, wash hands before and after eating, and 
  share the meal from a big tray. Sharing a meal is a sign of solidarity in the 
  community, and in this case it is an indication of encouragement for the groom 
  and social support for his family. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the video clips 
  and the reading texts show, the wedding may be officiated at a mosque, church, 
  the brides family home, or at a federal office by an authorized person, generally 
  a high-ranking government official. The ceremony can also take place inside 
  outside the house or building. Generally, the ceremony in a Muslim wedding, 
  does not include the bride. She remains excluded in many of the functions, even 
  the party at which she is congratulate and given wedding gifts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In any wedding 
  celebration, the bride is always the center of attention. Family, friends and 
  invited guests focus their attention on the bride. They are usually curious 
  about how well the bride looks, her wedding attire, makeup and the whole presentation. 
  This is also true about many African cultures regardless of whether the wedding 
  has traditional or non-traditional features. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The process of 
  adorning the bride with henna is mostly in the culture of the Swahili speaking 
  peoples. Usually the process is part of the celebrations and may take two or 
  more days. A lot of the rituals (such as bathing and putting perfume on the 
  bride) are private and not open to the public. However, hair dressing and body 
  decorations with henna can be done in public and family and friends may be invited 
  to watch and offer beauty and makeup suggestions. Members of the family partake 
  of the ritual by applying henna decorations on different parts of their bodies 
  too, in particular the arms, legs, feet, palms of the hands and feet. The designs 
  on the bride and other members of the family may look identical and are generally 
  a center of attraction at various wedding parties. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Depending on the 
  culture, there may be multiple celebrations where attendance is restricted along 
  gender lines. In Zanzibar, for example, women do not attend the men's party 
  that, often times, take place in a mosque. Like wise, men do not attend the 
  women's party unless they are in the dance group or are invited for special 
  party services like keeping order and providing a secured environment for the 
  party. This is also true of the people of mainland Tanzania. Women hold what 
  is known as kitchen party, a time where women give the bride advice and shower 
  her with gifts of items that are useful for kitchen use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of 
  Zanzibar, the women's party is usually different from the men's party in that 
  it is at the home of the bride's parents; it involves dance troops from both 
  sides of the family, a variety of food dishes, and gifts for the bride. In addition, 
  the bride does not appear in public at these celebrations; rather, she is represented 
  by her patron who receives the gifts on her behalf. The bride's wedding party 
  may last for several hours, most of which are spent in dancing, singing, gift 
  giving and receiving, and finally sharing some of the snacks brought for the 
  occasion. Unlike the men's party, a full meal is not shared by all the party 
  attendees. The food brought by the family members of the groom is intended for 
  the family of the bride only, not for friends and invited guests. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The party for the 
  bride is only one of the various wedding celebration activities which may continue 
  for several days. At the end of the celebrations (sometimes a week), the bride 
  is escorted to her husbands home by members of her family and friends. Often, 
  there is a lot of singing and dancing on the way to the groom's home. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Both the groom's 
  party and the bride's party may take place at home or a rented reception hall, 
  before or after the wedding ceremony. The setup as well as the order of related 
  events depends on the desires of the two families. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There is also 
  a tradition of bride presentation, a special ceremony where the bride is officially 
  handed over to the family of the groom. This tradition is comparable to western 
  tradition where the bride's father walks her down the isle to her future husband. 
  In the Swahili culture the same ceremony takes place a few days before the church 
  or court wedding. The ceremony is called 'bridal send-off-party or 'bridal farewell 
  party'. In the case of the tradition described here only uncles and aunts from 
  both sides of the family are involved. Parents take a low profile during this 
  time while other relatives assume most of the responsibilities in the preparation 
  of the main activities associated with the wedding. On the groom's side a similar 
  role is assumed by a paternal uncle or aunt. They come to the send-of-party 
  to receive the bride-to-be. They will also be the ones who will hand her over 
  to the groom on the actual wedding ceremony in church or elsewhere. <br>
  <br>
  Until recently, the groom did not attend the send-off-party. This is a new development 
  in the tradition. It is unclear what the new development means, but it seems 
  that the two families participate fully in all of the celebrations. Consequently, 
  the separate gatherings symbolize two wedding festivities, one at the bride's 
  home and another at the groom's home. If the venues are separated by distance 
  which requires much traveling, the send-off-party allows the bride and groom 
  to be with family and friends who would not be able to attend the wedding. At 
  both parties, family and friends may give their gifts to the bride and groom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The celebrations 
  show a combination of long held traditions which have greatly been influenced 
  by western values and traditions. The tradition of having a party whose purpose 
  if to gather family and friends of family to bid the bride farewell can be found 
  in any community in Africa. Traditionally, the party was attended by women only 
  and lasted for at least a week. Friends of the bride came to her home, cooked, 
  ate, sang and danced. Adults who could appear at the party included the bride's 
  aunts and grandmothers. The adults took the responsibility of providing the 
  bride-to-be with information that is considered crucial for her new life with 
  her husband and members of his family. They also used this time to adorn the 
  bride for the wedding day, prepare her wedding dress, jewelry, body decorations 
  and make-up. This tradition was abolished when missionaries arrived to spread 
  Christianity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Presently, a farewell 
  party lasts for a few hours and may cost a lot of money depending on the wealth 
  of the family and the number and type of invited friends and guests. The party 
  is a mixture of traditional customs, inter-ethnic customs, as well as western 
  customs. This can be seen in issues of hospitality, interaction formalities, 
  music, and form of dress, language use (ethnic, Swahili and English), types 
  of food and drink, and the manner in which guests are served and entertained. 
  How affluent a family is influences the formality and extent of the festivities 
  and how westernized the activities become. Despite the fact that the family 
  depicted on the video is very affluent, a lot of the traditional values seem 
  to be kept. It appears that a fair balance is maintained between the various 
  customs available to them. For example, there are representatives from the groom's 
  family at the party. They are invited in order for them to assume the guardianship 
  of the bride-to-be until the day of the wedding. They will present her to her 
  in-laws who do not, as a rule, attend the send-off-party. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Although the bride's 
  parents can come to the party, they play an insignificant role in the rituals 
  of the 'giving the bride away.' Major roles are played by the bride's aunt (mother's 
  sister) and uncle (father's brother). Another traditional feature is the party 
  cake which is a whole roasted goat instead of a baked flour cake that comes 
  from the western culture. Other adopted customs and traditions include songs, 
  dances, drinks, food types, the idea of a cake, the idea of toasting the bride 
  with Champagne and gift giving. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Because of the 
  change in the traditions of this farewell party, the inclusion of non-family 
  members, male and female makes it possible for the groom to show up too. He 
  is allowed to sit with his bride, but most of the activities do not involve 
  him except where both he and his future bride are asked to sit on stools to 
  receive advice from an elder. The advice is on how to lead a successful married 
  life. The groom is not allowed to share the farewell cake nor dance with the 
  bride at her farewell party. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The cost of both 
  the send-off-party and the wedding is borne by relatives and friends who contribute 
  as much as they are able to. This means that preparations for the events take 
  many months of fundraising. In many cases the bride and the groom will receive 
  contributions from co-workers. To ensure this support and to foster this cooperation, 
  some work places encourage their workers to contribute to a fund (generally 
  know as mfuko wa dharura emergency fund) from which they can draw financial 
  support whenever needed. This kind of cooperation among co-workers is also evident 
  in other times of hardships like a death in one's family. This mirrors the cultural 
  support and hospitality expected among the peoples of Africa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The culture of 
  celebrations has been enriched by the incorporation of other cultures from within 
  and from without. The tradition of slaughtering an animal for a feast is one 
  that is practiced by all ethnic groups. The selection of a goat has nothing 
  to do with the wedding celebrations. It has becomes a convenient way of symbolizing 
  that wide held tradition. It is also a cheap and easy way to get enough meat 
  for a small group of people, since the price of a goat is much lower compared 
  to that of a cow or a sheep. Rich families would, in this occasion, slaughter 
  a cow for additional meat, especially if the guest list is high. The presentation 
  of a whole roasted goat is only a mere gesture from the host, an invitation 
  as well as an appreciation for the guests in attendance. This appreciation follows 
  from the fact that an occasion such as this is very highly revered in the community. 
  It is widely believed that there are three important days in one's life; the 
  day an individual is born, the day they get married, and the day they die. In 
  this respect, the extent to which the celebrations are carried out reflects 
  the reverence accorded to the celebration of life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The process of 
  cutting the traditional cake follows from the western tradition, the source 
  of the idea of a wedding cake. Interestingly, this tradition is now widely practiced 
  by many affluent families and is occasionally extended to other celebrations 
  like birthdays and other children's religious events (first holy communion or 
  confirmation). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other western traditions 
  fully incorporated in many festivities like these, include extending well wishes 
  to the bride-to be by offering a toast using wine or champagne. Another tradition 
  is the western style dance, used as an opening dance by the couple, and a subsequent 
  invitation to all guests to dance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these celebrations 
  the mixing of cultures is apparent. The groom and his entourage are usually 
  dressed in western attire. The whole idea of a flower girl and a ring boy is 
  also foreign. The women, however, are dressed alike, wearing mostly traditional 
  attires. Typically, women form either side of the family would dress alike for 
  such an occasion and may choose to dress in western or traditional attire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The church service 
  as shown on the video clip has many western characteristics except for the songs 
  that are in Kiswahili. The bride and groom are dressed in western outfits and 
  have a flower girl, ring-boy, bride's maids, best-man and matron-of-honor, all 
  of whom are dressed in western wedding attire. Many of the family members and 
  friends are also dressed in western dress except the women. Some are have traditional 
  outfits while others have a mixture of the two.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There is also 
  a mixture of local and western customs in the church service. These include 
  the exchange of rings and the signing of the marriage certificate. What is different 
  is that the signing of the certificate takes place in the church in front of 
  everyone present. The procession in and out of church is also western based, 
  but the ululation from relatives, and the throwing of rice instead of flowers 
  to the couple, is proto-typical and relatively non-western. The wedding party, 
  like the church service, shows a mixture of both traditional and international 
  features. Two striking customs noticeable at the party include western dance, 
  the refreshments served, and the toasting of the bride and groom with champagne. 
  The traditional features include dances, the wedding cake which is a roasted 
  whole goat, and the local cuisine. <br>

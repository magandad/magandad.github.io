<p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Agreement</b><br>
  <br>
  The ki-vi group of nouns is the most stable of all noun groups whose agreement 
  remains constant across the board. That is, it reamains the same whether the 
  agreement between a noun and an adjective, possessive pronoun, associative -a, 
  or a verb. Thus: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> kipindi kimoja 
  vipindi vingi &#145;one period/many periods&#146;<br>
  kipindi kinaanza vipindi vinaanza &#145;the period(s) is/are starting&#146;<br>
  kipindi cha kwanza vipindi vya kesho &#145;The first period/tomorrow&#146;s 
  periods<br>
  kipindi changu vipindi vyangu &#145;period of mine/periods of mine&#146;<br>
  <br>
  Noun Group: &Oslash;/N - &Oslash;/N <br>
  Singular Plural<br>
  shughuli shughuli<br>
  wakati nyakati</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nouns in this group 
  are characterized by their maintaining the same form for singular and plural. 
  &Oslash; here means no prefix is added to the noun to indicate singular or plural 
  marking. It is important to point out that adjectives which take the same marking 
  prefix as the nouns show a variation with whereby the singular takes &Oslash;/N 
  while the plural takes only N marking for adjectives. The nouns take a variety 
  of agreement markers also when they combine with other parts of speech.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> shughuli moja 
  shughuli nyingi &#145;one activity/many activities&#146;<br>
  ratiba nzuri ratiba nzuri &#145;a good program/good programs&#146;<br>
  shughuli inaanza shughuli zinaanza &#145;the activit(ies) is/are beginning&#146;<br>
  shughuli yangu shughuli zangu &#145;my activity/activities<br>
  shughuli ya kwanza shughuli za kesho &#145;first activity/tomorrow&#146;s activities&#146;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Locative Nouns<br>
  Locations can be formed by adding -ni to a noun. In this section we have one 
  example: mezani &#145;on the table&#146; (meza + ni = table + suffix ni). Typical 
  examples include: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> nyumbani &#145;at 
  home&#146; <br>
  shuleni &#145; &#145;at school&#146;<br>
  maktabani &#145;at/in the library&#146;<br>
  hospitalini &#145;at/in the hospital&#146;<br>
  mjini &#145;at/in town&#146;<br>
  <br>
  More &#133;&lt;clickable&gt;<br>
  When any noun is given a -ni suffix, it no longer belongs to its original class. 
  Thus the grammatical role of the noun prefixes which identifies it with a specific 
  noun-class is suppressed. The relevant grammatical marker is the suffix -ni. 
  Thus, the noun assumes a locative meaning and controls the agreement for the 
  locative classes 16, 17&amp;18 also known as the pa-, ku-, m(u)- classes. These 
  prefixes identify the precise location in reference. pa- refers to a definite 
  location or location known to both the speaker and the hearer. ku- refers to 
  an indefinite location or a location unknown to at least one of the interlocutors 
  (generally the hearer). mu- refers to location inside.<br>
  <br>
  Review future tense and -na of association (see Unit 3 lesson 5)<br>
  The base form for the verb saidiana is saidia &#145;help.&#146; Saidiana translates 
  to &#145;help each other, a reciprocal meaning.&#146; There is no consensus 
  on the shape of the reciprocal form. Some scholars consider it to be -na, others 
  prefer &shy;&shy;-an- If we take the first suggestion, the structure of the 
  verb would be saidia-na making it appear like the reciprocal -na was added onto 
  the stem of the verb saidia. The second suggestion would imply that the structure 
  of the verb as: saidi-an-a, indicating that the form is attached onto the root 
  of the verb and may be followed by the final vowel of the verb. Many Bantuists 
  prefer the later but the function of the reciprocal is not affected by either 
  consideration of the reciprocal shape. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More &#133;.&lt;clickable&gt;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In many Bantu languages, 
  the reciprocal -an- is considered a verb extension and it is used to express 
  an activity involving plural subject. The meaning implies duality of the subjects 
  in the activity performed. However, it is often translated as &#145;each other.&#146; 
  For example: Juma na Asha wanapendana. &#145;Juma and Asha love each other.&#146; 
  Baba Ayub na Mama Asha wanaamkiana. &#145;Ayub&#146;s father and Asha&#146;s 
  mother are greeting each other.&#146; Juma na Ayub wanapigana. &#145;Juma and 
  Ayub are fighting each other.&#146; The duality of the subject interpretation 
  is apparent from the following examples excerpted from the reading text. Wanagawana 
  kazi za nyumbani. &#145;They divide home work between themselves.&#146; Walisaidiana 
  kupika. &#145;They assisted each other in the cooking.'<br>

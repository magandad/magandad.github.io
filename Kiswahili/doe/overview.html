      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This CD contains 
        six units comprising a total of thirty six lessons covering a range of 
        topics including &quot;Meeting one another&quot;, &quot;Knowing numbers&quot;, 
        &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Buying and Selling&quot; and 
        &quot;Education&quot;. These lessons are intended to provide the students 
        an illustration of Kiswahili culture and language with a set of conversations 
        between native speakers of Kiswahili. The synchronized presentation of 
        the three significant multimedia components of such as audio, video and 
        text illustrate each of these speech contexts in a very comprehensive 
        manner possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="4">Exercises:</font></b><br>
        <br>
        Every lesson is accompanied by a set of self-correcting exercises. These 
        exercises can be used to test one's competence in each lesson, after going 
        over it in a careful manner. Two types of exercises viz., self-correcting 
        and teacher-correcting types are provided to ensure the learning in two 
        different stages. The self-correcting exercises may be used as many times 
        as one needs necessary, prior to answer questions in teacher-correcting 
        exercises. Answers for the teacher-correcting exercises may be sent to 
        the instructor by email, provided you have internet connection at the 
        time of filling-in the answers. The answers can also be printed out and 
        hand over to the instructors when internet connection is not possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hyperlinks:<br>
        <br>
        Hyperlinks are provided appropriately enhancing an user-friendly navigation 
        through various lessons. It is designed in such a way that in each stage, 
        the user doesn't need to click more than three times to get to lessons 
        or exercises. The blue navigation bar at the top provides relative locations 
        of each page with respect to home. </font></p>

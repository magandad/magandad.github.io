<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this language, 
  the culture of buying and selling allows a wide latitude for bargaining. Venders 
  tend to set their prices high to leverage a reasonable profit after the buyer 
  has negotiated a reduction. For the most part, the initially stated price may 
  come down by as much as fifty percent. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are some 
  cases where bargaining is not part of the buying and selling culture. This includes 
  services like restaurants, postal, book and magazines, medication, and drinks. 
  In many of these cases the prices are set by the government after all necessary 
  levy has been added to cover local and import taxes. Once good are in the shops 
  or markets, no additional taxes are assed on the part of the buyer. Thus, the 
  seller may raise the price to cover the taxes he/she has paid to the government 
  and to make a small profit. Needless to say, the vendor may offer a discount 
  to his/her customer who has bought a number of items at once. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The culture of 
  bargaining offers a social aspect of the community that we need to consider. 
  By bargaining, the vendor and buyer engage in a social dialogue which also brings 
  out the art of negotiating. The culture looks up to negotiation as a valuable 
  social code that allows both parties time to interact in a friendly manner. 
  The buyer is seen as a guest who must be treated well and curiously while the 
  buyer sees the vendor as a host in whose house he/she must remain well behaved. 
  Anger, rudeness or impatience cannot be brought into the negotiation and at 
  the end of the interaction, the vendor is happy for selling his/her goods while 
  the buyer leaves believing that he/she had a good deal. In other words, all 
  parties leave feeling like winners.</font></p>

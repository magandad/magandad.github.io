<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It used to be easy 
  to describe the education system in East Africa as unique and specific to the 
  country in question. Nowadays, however, much of the education system looks up 
  to the western world in its curriculum and methodology. But, there are some 
  specifics that are not found in the western system. For example, at the elementary 
  level, students are expected to help with keeping their school clean and still 
  assemble before classes for important announcements. The level of discipline 
  is also very high, a much needed asset considering that classes are rather large 
  with between 100 and 150 students. Education is free with minimal contribution 
  from parents for supplies and minor school repairs. The schools can survive 
  on a bear minimum of resources. As such, students have high regard for the written 
  word and education is considered a privilege and not a right. While elementary 
  education is compulsory, very few have the opportunity to receive secondary 
  or university education. Thus, less than one percent of all those who graduate 
  at any given level continue beyond that level. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The emergence of 
  TV and other technological innovations continues to transform society and consequently 
  the quality of education. Students in many of the secondary schools and universities 
  have adapted to these innovations. Minor discrepancies can be noted but they 
  all depend on the resources available to individual schools. As such, it is 
  advisable for the learners who are interested in exploring about the education 
  system to consult the literature on the specifics.</font><br>

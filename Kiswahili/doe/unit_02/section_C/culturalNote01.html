<b>Cultural Note </b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
Until recently, birthrates were not an important aspect of ones life. The actual 
date of birth is not as important as the main event on the day one is born. In 
many cultures, one is named after the major event or experiences felt on he day 
they were born. For example, if one is born on a rainy day, they might be named 
as such and they name ould serve as a reminder to the individual as well as the 
community of that event or experience. Thus, birthrates and birthday celebration 
is a foreign concept necessitated by the need to document ones life for the purposes 
of services rendered by the civil service sectors of a government. It is, therefore, 
not uncommon to find an individual who does not know his or her birthrate and 
those of their loved ones like parents, siblings, and other relatives and friends. 
It is also uncommon for one to ask another for their birthrates. However, western<br>
influence has brought birthday celebrations, which are now in competition with 
other major dates in one&#146;s life, like weddings. Urban families have been 
the most affected by this foreign influence, spending to the tune of millions 
to celebrate a child&#146;s birthday. Even the typical English &#145;happy birthday&#146; 
song is an important element in</font> these celebrations

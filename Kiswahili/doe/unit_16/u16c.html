<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main cultural 
  note for this unit is gender separation in the Swahili culture, a consequence 
  of the Islamic religion to which many Swahili people are members. The best example 
  of the gender separation is the accessibility to certain parts of the house 
  of prayer. As the video shows, women are totally invisible in the mosque. The 
  entire congregation here is made up of men. On this particular day of prayer, 
  the women were assigned a place in another part of the mosque and listened to 
  the prayer and sermon through speakers. They could not see or be seen by the 
  prayer leader or the men in the mosque. This is a general practice and where 
  the mosque does not have a separate room for the women, they may be allowed 
  into the same location as the men, but must stay in the back a distance from 
  the men. The preference is for the women to be out of the sight of the men while 
  in pray.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the Christian 
  side, the video shows a mixture of western and local culture. The Sunday church 
  service is modeled on traditions that came with Christianity. This includes 
  the attire used by the celebrant and his aides. Except for the type of gifts 
  and the manner in which gifts are given as an offering, the rituals for the 
  Christian service follow from the western culture. The use of products, such 
  as food and drinks, as offering during the church service, is an addition to 
  the prototypical practice of giving money, a western concept of gift giving.

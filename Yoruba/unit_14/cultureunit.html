<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:blue'>Yorùbá numbering system</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Yorùbá numeral system is
intricate and unique. Majority of the numerals within the system are derived.
In actuality, with the exception of <b>one </b>to <b>ten </b>and isolated
numbers such as <b>twenty</b> <i>ogun;</i> <b>thirty </b><i>ogbon</i>; <b>two
hundred</b><i> igba</i>; <b>three hundred</b> oodunrun; and <b>four hundred</b>
irinwo, all others are derived. Excluding thirty, three hundred and four
hundred, these exceptions in fact serve as the ‘building blocks’ for the
formation of the other numerals in Yorùbá. This is most obvious in the
formation of numerals within the range of eleven to one hundred and
ninety-nine. Numbers one to ten: okan, eji, eta, erin, arun, efa, eje, ejo,
esan, <i>and</i> ewa serve as the core counting forms in the system. There are
various types of reckoning for these numbers, they are done in slightly
different tongues such as eni/ookan, eeji, eeta, eerin, aarun-un, eefa, eeje,
eejo, eesan-an,<i> and</i> eewa. Beyond counting, Yorùbá numbers serve as
numeral qualifiers and they come in the forms of ordinals and cardinals which
are adjective forms in the language. There are also numbers that serve a larger
than numeral role in Yorùbá mythology, religion and world view. Numbers such as
seven, fifteen (also used in its reduced form eedogun), twenty (also known as
okoo), forty and two hundred (also known as ogowa) are significant in various
renditions about Yorùbá beliefs and lifestyle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:blue'>Yorùbá numbers as Modifiers (Cardinals
and Ordinals)</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Another type of reckoning for Yorùbá
numbers through which counting can also be done is to mark them by <b>m____</b>
with the exception of the multiples of ten (there forms do not change) and
number one that has two alternate forms (kan or meni). These forms are usually
answers to the question <i>meloo?</i> ‘how many?’ and would include: meni,
meji, meta, merin marun-un, mefa,…. mewa… marundinlogun and so on. These are
regarded as cardinals forms even though their basic meanings are the same as
the basic counting forms. Ordinals are used to show different positions such as
first, second, third etc. They take reckonings of positions- in “order” of
merit. These forms are used to answer the question Kelòó “which position.’ Just
like the counting forms and cardinals, there are also many reckoning types for
ordinals in Yorùbá. The first type is: kìn-in-ní/kinni, kejì, kcta etc. The
second type is classified as nominal and can also be in two forms as follows: Ekinní,
èkejì, {kcta etc. <b><i>or</i></b>  ìkinní, ìkejì, ìkcta etc. As stated before,
numerals in Yorùbá can act as modifiers to other nouns in the language. </p>

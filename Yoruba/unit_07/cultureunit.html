<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Yoruba people place great
value on personal responsibility within the community. The day is divided into
parts which helps the Yoruba people, even in traditional societies, to
structure their daily existence. It is also believed that there is a good time
suited for every activity and so, each Yoruba person is expected to manifest
individual responsibility by planning their day and lives in such a way to
maximize productivity. As they are wont to say, ‘òwúrò lójó’ meaning that the
morning has great value and would be best time to work hard. Likewise, they commonly
hold that a responsible schedule must include time for relaxation. The day is
divided into parts which helps the Yoruba people, even in traditional
societies, to structure their daily existence. There are several parts to the
day. <i>Idaji</i> or <i>afejumo</i> is the dawn; <i>owuro</i> or <i>aaro</i> is
morning; <i>iyaleta</i> is mid day; <i>osan</i> is the afternoon; <i>irole</i>
is evening/dusk which, traditionally, marks the end of the work day; <i>ale</i>
is night time following dusk; and <i>oru</i> is middle of the night when
everyone is presumed sleeping. The Yoruba associate time in the life of an
individual with developmental growth corresponding to the progression of time
in a day. The Yoruba believe that one must ‘wake-up’ in life and do things that
must be done at the appropriate time. For instance, when an individual is old
enough to own a farmland, he must be given one by his father or by the <i>Olori-ebi</i>
(Family head). When he/she is old enough to get marry just like his peers,
he/she must not tarry or else, people around him will call him to a meeting and
tell him/her in a subtle way through proverbs and wise saying. Particularly,
they believe that one must work hard when one is young and that in one’s old
age<i> or ojo ale</i>, one must sit down to enjoy all that one has labored for
in life. Anybody, for whatsoever reason, still works when he/she is old and in
the <i>ale </i>of their life is not favorably viewed in the society at all. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Yoruba abhor dirty environment. They place high
premium on their personal hygiene and even take absolute pride in living a
healthy life. This is reflected in the personal names they bear. Some of these
names include <i>marindoti</i> “don’t walk around dirty,<i>” ajisefinni</i> “he
who wakes up to look very neat.” Personal hygiene for the Yoruba begins with
dental hygiene. They have chewing sticks of various kinds that they use in
cleaning their teeth. These chewing sticks or <i>orin</i> are roots or branches
considered antiseptic and medicinal. These render the teeth white, the mouth odorless
and free of germs. Women deliberately create gap teeth by filing a portion of
the two front teeth. These gap teeth make them to look pretty. Bathing, at
least once a day is a must. During the dry season, when the heat is high, they
can bathe two to three times a day. They use different local lotions to rub
their body. Some of these include; <i>epo gbigba or </i>heated palm oil;<i> epo
pupa </i>or<i> </i>red oil<i>; osun </i>or<i> </i>camwood ointment<i>; adi
agbon </i>or<i> </i>palm kernel oil and <i>ororo </i>or vegetable oil, just to
mention a few. They also rub their hands and the outer parts of their legs with
<i>laali</i>. It is customary for women to cut their nails, both hands and legs
regularly, while men leave theirs to grow, but they still maintain it
regularly. Women and older men put on <i>tiro</i> or stibiun to their
eyelashes. They also add powder (which is grinded from a type of stone) to
their faces after bathing. As men go about with their heads cleanly and neatly
shaven every time, the reverse is the case with women who ‘consider their hair
as the glory of the woman.’ They take care of their hair in two major ways.
They plait and they weave. There are many types of plaiting that women readily
pick any type they want. Some of these include <i>kolese, ipako-elede,</i> <i>suku,
kojusoko, alagogo, konkoso </i>etc<i>.<b><u>                </u></b></i></p>

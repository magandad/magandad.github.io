                <br>
                Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; is a tonal language spoken natively by about
                thirty million people Nigeria and in the neighboring countries
                of the Republic of Benin and Togo. In Nigeria, Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; speakers
                reside in the Southwest region in states such as Oyo, Ogun, Osun,
                Ondo, Ekiti, Lagos, Kogi and Kwara states. Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; is
                a Kwa language, which belongs to the Yoruboid group under the
                Niger-Congo phylum. It has three basic but significant tones.
                One of the effects of the large number of Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; speakers
                and their geographic spread is the emergence of geography-bound
                linguistic variations. Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; is a dialect continuum
                including several distinct dialects (Bamgbose (1966)). Estimates
                of the total number of Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; dialects vary from
                twelve to twenty-six (Ojo (1977), Adetugbo (1982), Oyelaran (1970,
                1992), Mustapha (1987), Ojo (2001). <br>
                The differences inherent in these dialects are marked in the
                areas of pronunciation, grammatical structure and vocabulary.
                There are other dialects found all over West Africa. In the Republic
                of Benin, Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; dialects include Ketu, Nago, Ije,
                Ajase, Idaitsa, Tsabe; while Ana and Itsa are two of the dialects
                found in Togo. Some Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; dialects are also found
                in the African Diaspora, especially the Caribbean. The dialect
                of Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; used in Brazil is called Nago, while
                the one used in Cuba is referred to as Lucumi. It is however
                possible to classify Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; dialectal forms, found
                in Nigeria, into five regional groupings: North-West Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; (NWY);
                North Eastern Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; (NEY); Central Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; (CY);
                South-West Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; (SWY); South-East Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; (SEY).
                Phonological, lexical and grammatical variations are the hallmarks
                of these groupings since there are variant degrees of mutual
                intelligibility among the &#8216;geographic&#8217; dialects found
                in each group. A consensus standard form has however evolved
                and is recognized as the form for writing and teaching the language.
                This form, relatively close to the SWY, is understood by speakers
                of all the different dialects and it continues to serve the communicative
                purpose of all speakers. <br>
                <br>
                In the 1960s through the 1970s, various orthography committees
                were set up, by both government and academic groups, to consider
                and subsequently review the standard orthography for the language.
                Significant reviews were done based on the report of the orthography
                committee in 1966. It is primarily the basis for the creation
                and introduction into schools of the standard Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; orthography
                and hence for the standard Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; language. The
                standard form of Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; is the type of Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; learned
                at school, and spoken (or written) mostly by educated native
                speakers to addressees who speak different dialects (Bamgbose
                (1966)). The language is one of the three national languages
                in Nigeria. It is an honor due, in part, to the socio-political
                importance and sheer number of its speakers. This has translated
                into socio-linguistic developments for the language in terms
                of its study and usage in the country. <br>
                <br>
                As with many other African languages, the earliest study of the
                Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; language was done by missionaries interested
                in translating the scriptures for evangelical purposes. The peculiar
                outcome of these efforts (coupled with the abolition of slavery)
                was the emergence of the writing and studying of the Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; language
                and culture among settled free slaves in Sierra Leone. Known
                as Aku, these Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; people did pioneering work
                on the writing and studying of the language, such that Yor&ugrave;b&aacute; became
                one of the first West African languages to have a written grammar
                and dictionary in 1849. Since then, work has continued in and
                on the language until today. There are many grammars, dictionaries
                and literary texts in the language today.</font> </p>

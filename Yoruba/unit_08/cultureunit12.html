<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It will be an understatement to
say that the Yoruba cherished greetings so much. We can equally say that
greetings are inseparable from the Yoruba because, this is the first thing a
stranger will notice when he meets the Yoruba people. In fact, the Yoruba men
and women rescued from slavery by the British warship and settled in Freetown
in the present Republic of Sierra Leone at the beginning of 19<sup>th</sup>
century were known and called ‘Aku’ which is the prefix that is attached to all
types of greetings in Yoruba. Greeting is a way of showing respect to each
other, not only between an elder and a younger one, but also between peers. A
child or an adult who wakes up in the morning, meet people on their way, and do
not greet them is regarded as being untutored and without the required home
training. Greeting is very vital to communication and community life among the Yoruba
because it acts as a motivator of some sort. The absence of an appropriate
greeting, whenever it is required can be the beginning of an age long
hostility. For instance, if two people or even two families, at loggerhead on
any issue, have stopped all forms of communication, per adventure any one of
them gives birth, it is incumbent and mandatory for the other to greet him or her,
just for the safe delivery of the baby. The grudge and its accompanying
hostilities can continue. If he/she refuses to do so, it will be assumed that
overtly or covertly, the other person or group has been planning something
sinister for the expectant mother. When one is receiving a guest, whether a
stranger or someone that is known, one must treat the person ‘generously’. The
content of the greeting may include questions about the trip, how stressful it
is, the cost of transportation, how he/she is able to locate the house and so
on. After all these salutations, the proper business of the visit will now
commence. After the conclusion of the business and the guest is ready to leave,
the host must see him/her off with appropriate greetings.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also no hard and fast
rule about who greet first. However, it is preferable for the young person to
initiate the greetings. In most situations, it is the first person to see that
greets first; either young or old. However, when the younger ones are greeting
the elders, the boys will prostrate- full stretch with their chests and chin on
the ground while the girls will knee down with their two knees. They, then,
greet as circumstance demands. They will be in the position until the elders
complete their own part of the greetings. The process of the greeting can be
between three to five minutes. It is forbidden for the younger ones to look
into the eyes of the older ones in the process of greeting. While the younger
ones are on their knees or prostrating (as the case may be) the elders will be
saying all his/her <i>oriki </i>or praise and attributive names, both personal
and family ones. It is also forbidden for the younger ones to say the <i>oriki</i>
of the older ones. </font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><b><u><span
style='color:blue'><a name="para3" id="para3"> </a>What are honorific pronouns?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are so called here because
of their function as marks of respect and honor in the Yoruba language and
culture. These are the plural forms of regular Yoruba pronouns that are used, out
of deference, to refer to a single older or senior person. It will be regarded
disrespectful and rude if a young person or junior fails to use the ‘honorific
pronouns’ in addressing or in referring to an older person or senior. The use
of these pronouns is crucial in greetings but it applies to speech in all
aspects of life. The ‘honorific pronouns include: E ‘You (plural),’ won ‘they/them’
and yin ‘you (plural).’</font></p>

style='color:blue'><a name="para4" id="para4"> </a>What are the types of Yoruba greetings?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greetings in Yoruba are
countless. There is no occasion that does not have its distinct and peculiar
greeting. For days and seasons, there are greetings for very early morning,
morning, mid-day, afternoon, evening and night. There are also special
greetings for the seasons and the different festivals when there is food
drought and when there is plenty to eat. All occupations, trades, and
professions have different greetings peculiar to each of them. Some of these
include, among others, farmers, hunters, black smith, traders, teachers, the
diviners, hair dressers, etc. In addition, different states of health have
their own greetings. For instance, a person that is seriously ill has one,
someone recuperating has too. There are also greetings to be offered at
funerals. The age of the deceased determines the type of greeting. For
instance, there are different types of greetings for deaths that are considered
premature and deaths that are considered to be matured. There is a type for
greeting when one is embarking on a journey, another when you are right within
the trip and another upon arrival. There are separate greetings for barren
women, expectant mother, immediately after delivery and in the process of
breast feeding and weaning of the baby.</font><br>

style='color:blue'><a name="para5" id="para5"> </a></span></u></b>What are the roles of greetings in the family?</font></strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
<br>
Within the family setting, both nuclear and extended, greetings are crucial.
Young people are trained to learn and offer greetings for each appropriate time
or occasion. Leading by example, the Baale or family head wakes up very early
in the morning and greets everybody within the compound. In the process of greeting,
he mentions their names individually, no matter how young or old. In this process,
he makes enquiry about the state of their health, work, and even progress. Since
he is the Baale, he knows the oriki or praise and attributive names of everybody
within the nuclear and extended family. As the greetings progress, he laced them
with individual’s attributive and praise names. This early morning greetings
are particularly important in the Yoruba setting. Any Baale that does not do
this is regarded as irresponsible and ignoring his duty to his family members.
This opportunity of early morning greetings is also used acquainting himself
with state of affairs of everybody within his ‘community’.</font><br>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yoruba take friendship serious. Friends may be
of the same age grade or one of them may even be older than the other. A friend
is known as <i>‘òré.’</i> To the Yoruba people, general acquaintances or <i>‘àmòrí’</i>
are many but it is only an <i>‘òré’</i> that will constantly provide support. There
are therefore many levels of friendship: <i>‘òré tòótó’ </i>is the true friend
that provides support during the difficult times; <i>‘òré tímótímó’ </i>is the
very close friend; and <i>‘òré kòríkòsún’ is the </i>‘inseparable’ best friend.’<i>
</i>These however do not represent any actual scale of closeness but rather it
identifies how one can perceive different friends and different friendships. It
is possible for one person to be(come) all these to another person. In
actuality, Yoruba people are of the opinion that some friends are or do become
closer than blood relations. Those who are so close do almost everything in
common ranging from building of the same type of structure, wearing the same
type of attire when going for any function to having their farmland situated together.
Some may even go to the extent of allowing their children to marry each other
with the belief that it will further strengthen their friendship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is also a known fact that close friendships
have been the basis for the establishment of many great organizations and businesses.
Popular belief has it that such unions, ‘<i>òré degbé</i>’ group borne of
friendship, are the best and most durable social grouping. It is actually the
‘friendship’ spirit that sustains the extended family within Yoruba societies.
As a unit consisting of many nuclear families, the various members of the
family are primarily expected to respect their elders but they are also
required to be cordial in their dealings with age mates and younger people in
the family. Outside the family, a significant level of cordiality is also
expected amongst people who share similar trades or in modern times, are
co-workers.  </span></p>

margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>Traditionally, the female members of the
Yorùbá society are considered the culinary experts and manager of the family
cuisine. This major role is in addition of the major contributions that they
make in the agricultural sector. Things are changing nowadays with both men and
women getting involved in food preparation. Children, particularly girls, are
expected to be fully involved in the food preparation process, from helping to
prepare the ingredients such as grinding pepper or grains to the actual
cooking. The cooking areas in traditional compounds are mostly located in the
rear or side of the house. These are often physical structures constructed to
allow for adequate ventilation and storage. Traditionally, Yorùbá people were
not known for cooking within their living quarters but that is also changing in
the contemporary Yorùbá society. In addition to providing assistance to the
cooks, children learn how to cook by observing their mothers and seniors as
they cook. This is interesting because this practical method makes food
preparation experiential allowing the young women to learn their mistakes and
successes. Uniquely, Yorùbá people do not include definite measurements in
their recipes and so the amount of ingredients for preparing each meal will
based on practical factors such as the taste and experience of the cook and the
amount of food to be prepared or the number of guests. This imprecise
measurement of ingredients even applies in today’s society including the
preparation of non-traditional meals.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>Numerous foods abound in various parts of
Yorùbá land. Other types of food are also in the land due to the interaction of
the Yorùbá people with other ethnic groups or nationalities. These include yam
(boiled, fried or roasted, yam flour, and meals made from yam such as<i>
ikokore</i>, <i>asaro</i>, <i>dundu</i>), cassava (and its various derivatives
such as gaari and lafun), bean (and its various derivatives like akara, or bean
cake, moin-moin, and cooked beans), and corn (roasted or boiled and its various
derivatives like ogi, eko) among others. While some of these foods are common
to the generality of the Yorùbá people, there are some that are more localized
in certain parts of the land. For instance, although pounded yam can be found
in almost all parts of Yorùbá land, the Ekiti, Ijesa, Ife and Akure are fond of
it. The Oyo are fond of prepared yam flour more than any other group. The Egba
are fond of cassava flour more than any other group while the Ijebu are fond of
ikokore and gaari. Rice and its various derivatives can also be found in all
parts of Yorùbá land. We are not too certain if it is indigenous to the people
or if it is introduced to them by Europeans or nations from the Sahel. We are, however, sure that bread is introduced to them by the Europeans. Different
varieties of food can also be made from corn. Some of these include, <i>ogi,
eko, Kengbe / Adalu,</i> <i>tuwo;</i> <i>gúgúrú </i>etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify'>One thing that is common to yam, cassava,
and plantain is that they can be processed and ground into flours. The flours
can then be kept in cool and dry places. Whenever one is ready to eat it, very
hot water is needed. Certain quantity is poured into the boiled water. It is
stirred and mixed together for a while until it is firm. The food is then
served into plates. There are various types of stew and soup that can be used
in eating the prepared food. Vegetable soup is common among the Yorùbá. Stew is
equally prepared in separate pot with meat, fish, or<i> poultry. </i>The two
are then added together in a plate and served with pounded yam, cassava flour
or even plantain flour. This meal combination highlights Yoruba traditional
cuisine. Interestingly, this combination (meal, stew and meat/fish) is the
pre-eminent lunch in contemporary Yoruba society. Since Yoruba live a communal
life. The entire extended family, in most cases, eats together in a single
plate. The food is served into a big bowl and everybody sit round it. Each one
dips his hand into the dish and takes a morsel in strict order of seniority. By
the time the food is diminishing in the bowl, care is taken to leave part some
portion for the youngest.      </p>

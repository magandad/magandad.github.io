Numerous foods abound in various parts of Yoruba land. While some of these
foods are common to the generality of the Yoruba people, there are some that
are restricted to certain parts of the land. Other types of food are also in the
land due to the interaction of the Yoruba people with other tribes or
nationalities.</p>

The staple foods are yam, boiled, fried or roasted, yam flour, ikokore, asaro, or
ebe, and so on. Bean and its various derivatives like akara, or bean cake, moin-moin,
cooked beans, and so on. Corn and its various derivatives like ogi, eko,
plantain flour, roasted or boiled. Some of these foods that are also localized
as mentioned above. Although, pounded yam can be found in almost all parts of
Yoruba land, the Ekiti, Ijesa, Ife and Akure are fond of it. The Oyo are fond
of prepared yam flour and partly cassava flour more than any other group. The
Egba are fond of cassava flour more than any other group while the Ijebu are
fond of ikokore and gaari.</p>

Rice and its various derivatives can also be found in all parts of Yoruba land.
We are not too certain if it indigenous to the people or if it is introduced to
them by the Europeans. We are, however, sure that bread is introduced to them
by the Europeans. Different types of varieties can also be found in corn. Some
of these include, <i>ogi, eko</i> etc. </p>

One thing that is common to yam, cassava, and plantain is that they can be prepared
into flours. The flour can then be kept in cool and dry place. Whenever one is
ready to eat it, extremely hot water is needed. Certain quantity is poured into
the boiled water. It is stirred and mixed together for a while until it is
firm. The food is then served into plates. There are various types of stew and
soup that can be used in eating the prepared food. Vegetable soup is common
among the Yoruba. Stew is equally prepared in separate pot with meat, fish, or<i>
ponmo</i> (beef skin). The two are then added together in a plate and served
with pounded yam, cassava flour or even plantain flour.</p>

Yoruba live a communal life. The entire extended family, in most cases, eats
together in a single plate. The food is served into a big bowl and everybody
sit round it. Each one dips his hand into the dish and takes a morsel in strict
order of seniority. By the time the food is diminishing in the bowl, care is
taken to leave part some portion for the
youngest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

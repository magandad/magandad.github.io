<p class=MsoBodyText>The Yoruba have peculiar types of clothes that make them
distinct from other cultures. They have <i>Aso ibile</i>, the traditional
clothes of various types and shades. Both male and female have different types
and it is an aberration then for a man to wear a woman’s clothes and vice
versa. Before the advent of the Europeans to the Yoruba land, only hand woven
clothes were available. The Yoruba started from using <i>ibante</i> (a piece of
thick hand woven cloth). It is only used for covering the private parts of both
male and female. <i>Ibante</i> is made from a type of cloth called <i>kijipa</i>.
(It is a tarpaulin – like cloth). It is usually very thick and can withstand
any stress. Later on, people started wearing normal cloth that is made from <i>aso-oke</i>.
Some of these types of <i>aso-oke</i> materials include <i>etu, petuje, san-an-yan,
alaaari </i>and so on. For men’s wear, they have <i>buba</i>, <i>esiki </i>and<i>
sapara</i>, which are regarded as <i>ewu awotele</i> or under wear, while they
also have <i>dandogo, agbada, gbariye,</i> <i>sulia and oyala</i>, which are
also known as <i>ewu awoleke</i> or over wears. They also have various types of
<i>sokoto</i> or native trousers that are sown alongside the above-mentioned
dresses. Some of these are <i>kembe, gbanu, sooro, kamu, sokoto elemu</i>, etc.
A man’s dressing is incomplete without a cap. Some of these caps include, but are
not limited to, <i>Gobi</i><i>, tinko, abeti-aja, alagbaa, oribi, bentigoo,
onide, and labankada.</i> The tailors and the designers have various styles and
patterns that they do to these caps and the various dresses mentioned above.
All these add to the aesthetic values of these traditional wears and the person
who put them on. It must be noted that the culture of under wears, as in pants,
brassiere etc. is a culture borrowed from the Europeans.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Women also have different types of dresses. The most
commonly found are <i>iro </i>and<i> buba </i>or wrapper with a blouse–like loose
top with the sleeve almost getting to the wrist. Women also have <i>gele</i> or
head gear that must be put on whenever the <i>iro and buba</i> is on. Just as
the cap is important to men<i>,</i> women’s dressing is incomplete if<i> gele</i>
is not put on. This gele is wound twice round the head and tucked on one side.
It may be of plain cloth or costly as the women can afford. Apart from this,
they also have <i>iborun</i> or <i>ipele</i>. It is like a miniature wrapper
that is hanged on the left shoulder of women. At times, it is tied round their
waists over the wrapper. Unlike men, women have two types of under wears that
we call <i>tobi and sinmi. Tobi</i> is like the modern day apron with strings
and spaces in which women can keep their money. They tie this <i>tobi</i> around
their waists before putting on the <i>iro. Sinmi</i> is like a sleeveless
T-shirt that is worn under before wearing any other dress. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the contemporary period, the Yoruba wear various types
of clothing because of their interactions with other cultures, especially
through education, trade, travel and religion. This is why it is possible to
see some Yoruba people with suits and ties and some others with heavy turbans
on hot sunny afternoons. The Yoruba wear modern clothings like shirts and trousers,
skirts and blouses, suits, gowns that are all borrowed from the Europeans. They
also wear caftan, babanriga, Senegalese boubou and the likes that are all
borrowed from the Arabs and other cultures in Africa. It must be noted,
however, that most of the materials used for sowing the above dresses vary.
While some of these fabrics include various types of lace materials, guinea
brocade materials, ankras, linens and others that are imported into the
country, the Yoruba also make use of <i>adire</i> and <i>batiks</i> that have
their roots in Yoruba land. All these are also used for sewing various types of
dresses. The colors of the various types of clothing described above vary.
While some combine many of the primary and secondary colors, others are just
single color like blue, green, white, red, yellow, and so no. Despite these
developments, the Yoruba are still patronizing a fraction of their traditional
wears. For men, only <i>agbada, buba, sokoto</i> and various types of<i> fila</i>
or caps are still in use. Women also wear only iro<i>, buba, and gele. Tobi and
sinmi</i> are no longer in use. Majority of others discussed above cannot be
commonly found in the cities. Relics of these are still been found in the
villages and the county sides. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><b><u><span style='color:blue'>Personal
Hygiene and Body adornment</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Yoruba abhor dirty environment. They place high
premium on their personal hygiene and even take absolute pride in living a
healthy life. This is reflected in the personal names they bear. Some of these
names include <i>marindoti</i> “don’t walk around dirty,<i>” ajisefinni</i> “he
who wakes up to look very neat.” Personal hygiene for the Yoruba begins with
dental hygiene. They have chewing sticks of various kinds that they use in
cleaning their teeth. These chewing sticks or <i>orin</i> are roots or branches
considered antiseptic and medicinal. These render the teeth white, the mouth odorless
and free of germs. Women deliberately create gap teeth by filing a portion of
the two front teeth. These gap teeth make them to look pretty. Bathing, at
least once a day is a must. During the dry season, when the heat is high, they
can bathe two to three times a day. They use different local lotions to rub
their body. Some of these include; <i>epo gbigba or </i>heated palm oil;<i> epo
pupa </i>or<i> </i>red oil<i>; osun </i>or<i> </i>camwood ointment<i>; adi
agbon </i>or<i> </i>palm kernel oil and <i>ororo </i>or vegetable oil, just to
mention a few. They also rub their hands and the outer parts of their legs with
<i>laali</i>. It is customary for women to cut their nails, both hands and legs
regularly, while men leave theirs to grow, but they still maintain it
regularly. Women and older men put on <i>tiro</i> or stibiun to their
eyelashes. They also add powder (which is grinded from a type of stone) to
their faces after bathing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>       There are many types of beads, hand laces,
necklaces; bangles that are abound in Yoruba land that both male and female put
on. Chiefs, kings or people from the royal family, especially, use some of
these beads, often. Some of these beads include <i>iyun</i>, <i>lagidigba, akun</i>,
etc.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>     As men go about with their heads cleanly and neatly
shaven every time, the reverse is the case with women who ‘consider their hair
as the glory of the woman’. They take care of their hair in two major ways.
They plait and they weave. There are many types of plaiting that women readily
pick any type they want. Some of these include <i>kolese, ipako-elede,</i> <i>suku,
kojusoko, alagogo, konkoso </i>etc<i>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i>     </i>The Yoruba consider tribal marks as ways of
adding beauty to the face of individuals. This is apart from the fact that they
show clearly from which part of Yoruba land an individual come from.  Different
types of tribal marks are made with local blades or knives on the cheeks. In
some parts of Yoruba land, the <i>Oloola</i> have to shave the head of the kids
well before the tribal marks are given. This is because the tribal marks extend
to the head.   There are some people whose occupation is to make tribal marks
on the faces of these children. They are called <i>Oloola.</i> These are done
at infancy, when children may not feel the pain much. Some of these tribal
marks include <i>Pele, abaja-egba, abaja-owu,</i> <i>abaja-merin, keke, gombo,
ture, pele Ife, Keke owu, pele Ijebu, </i>etc<i>.                      </i></p>

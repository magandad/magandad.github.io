In the pre-colonial period, the Yoruba have what we called <i>eko-ile</i> (Home
training).It is not only the responsibility of the parents to teach their
children how to behave well in the society, it is equally the duties of all
within the neighborhood to assist in one way or the other in the proper
training of the kids. For instance, if a neighbor sights a kid misbehaving, it
behoves on the neighbor to call him to order or even scold the kid. Some of the
trainings a child receives at home include, but are not restricted to the
following, proper greetings as at when due, how to take care of the household
chores, respect for elders, how to attend to visitors promptly, etc. A
classical example of home training is for a child to intrude into the
conversation of his elders, without being asked to do so. He must even leave
the scene, except heÅfs asked to stay or contribute to the discussion. The
Yoruba believes that itÅfs better not to have a child than to have one that is
not trained. This is reflected in the proverb that says <i>a kuku u bi egbe
agan</i> Ågbetter not have any offspring comparable to barren woman.Åh<b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>However,
with the advent of the Europeans, the Yoruba embrace western education.
Although, the primary intention of the missionaries who brought western
education was mainly to enable the people read and write so as to be able to
read the bible and other Christian religious literatures. They were also
trained to be court clerks, interpreters, and other religious related jobs.
However, as time goes on, the Yoruba were found in other fields of human
endeavors.</p>

The Yoruba cherish education to the extent that every parent strives to educate
his children. Parents go to the extent of selling whatever they have to pay for
the childrenÅfs school fees. We have also seen cases of those in the high places
today, who confessed that they have to do one menial job or the other to be
able to send themselves to school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>The
Yoruba, just like other sections of the country, operate the British system of
education (because of the reasons given above).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Schools
are both publicly owned or privately owned from primary to the University
level. Both Christians and Muslims are also engaged in the business of
education.</p>

Elementary education starts from pre-nursery stage. This is what is called <i>Je
le o</i> <i>sinmi</i> Åelet the house have restÅf. The teachers in this case only
keep the kids so as to allow the mothers of these kids go about their normal
business. (Although, these types of schools are mainly for children of the
lower class).Although, we have seen cases of some of these <i>Je le o sinmi</i>
turning into a full blown school later on. There is also the nursery, primary
and secondary schools within the education system. Pupils spend three to four
years in the nursery school before proceeding to primary school. The primary
school is six years. The secondary education is divided into two, viz; junior
and senior; each of them is three years. After the completion of the junior
secondary education the student is expected to write an exam. Students then
proceed to the senior secondary school after passing the junior exams. However,
those who failed are expected to go to the Technical College where they are
expected to be given<b> </b>training in vocational courses like,
auto-mechanics, building construction, home management, clothing and textiles,
etc. There is also the Universal Basic Education which is of nine year
duration. This comprises of 6 years of primary education and 3 years of junior
secondary education. It is free and compulsory. It also includes adult and
non-formal education programs at primary and junior secondary education levels
for the adults and out-of-school youths.</p>

Currently, there are two examination bodies that conduct exam for the senior
secondary schools. These are the National Examination Council of Nigeria (NECO)
and the West African Examination Council. (WAEC).These exams are usually
conducted between May and June of each year. They are also expected to conduct
exams for matured students in November/December. It must be noted that from
nursery to secondary school level, wearing of uniforms are compulsory for every
student. Each school has a different type of uniform thatÅfs different from others
in the same neighborhood. Uniforms bring uniformity among the students thereby
creating an environment that promotes a sense of equality and eliminates
possible competitions among students due to the class or economic status of
their parents/family. At the end of the day, students are able to pay less
attention to their appearance and concentrate their efforts to the advancement
of academic skills without the influence of the socio-economic status of their
peers.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Tertiary
education can be grouped into three. These are Colleges of Education that
combine training in education with other courses, Mono or Polytechnics where
students are trained in all aspects of technical education, agriculture
inclusive. Universities have both the conventional ones and the specialized
ones. Some of the specialized ones include University of Agriculture and the University of Science and Technology. Prospective students to the tertiary institutions
write a joint qualifying examination before gaining admission. This examination
is conducted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).Majority of
these Tertiary institutions also have various part-time programs for matured
students and those who could not make it to the University for full time
programs for one reason or the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Apart
from JAMB, WAEC and NECO that we mentioned above, we also have other
controlling bodies like the National Universities Commission(NUC),a body that
oversee the Universities, National Board for Technical Education, a body that
oversee both mono and polytechnics and the National Commission for Colleges of
Education, a body that oversee the colleges of Education. We also have the
National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).This is the body that conducts a-one year
paramilitary training for graduating students of both Polytechnics and
Universities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>We
also have inter-University bodies that service some of these Universities. They
offer certain levels of training for the students.They are National Mathematical
Center, National Institute for Nigerian Languages? It must be noted, however,
that majority of this bodies are established for the entire country and not for
the Yoruba speaking areas alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'>The
traditional Yoruba professions are associated with families. Each of the
extended family living together is known for a profession. It is mostly
uncommon for people to learn a different vocation that is not inherited from
within the family. Anybody that does this in Yoruba land is regarded as being
lazy. Children born into the family learn the professions as they grow up. They
eventually inherit it when their father died. As mentioned above, different
professions abound in Yoruba land. While some of these professions are gender specific,
others can be taken by both sexes. For instance, both male and female can take
to farming as professions but only male can take to drumming or hunting, while
only female can take to dying or oil-making business, pottery, soap making, making
of indigo dye etc. One thing that is peculiar with professions in Yoruba land is
that one can determine the profession of a family from the names they bear. For
instance, any family that bears names like, Ayanwale, Ayanbiyi, Ayanyemi, and
so on are likely to be drummers, while names like Ogunyemi, Ogunwale, Odebiyi
are given by families who are hunters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'>While it may
not be possible to discuss all the professions that we have in Yoruba land, we
will take a look at five of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><i>Farming:</i>
       </b>This is the most prominent of all the professions that we have in
Yoruba land. Since food is the sustainer of life, the profession is regarded as
the mother of all professions. As they say, <i>Agbe loba</i> &quot;the farmer
is the king&quot; and that<i> bebi ba ti kuro ninu ise, ise buse</i> &quot;as
long as one can satisfy hunger, one is not impoverished” The basic implements
that is used for farming are cutlasses and hoes. But with modern technology;
farmers now make use of tractors, planters, sowers, and so on. Farming is categorized
according to both the distance and the nature of soil and land. Hence, we have <i>oko-egan,
oko-etile, akuro, and ogba. </i>For <i>oko-egan</i>, it is normally quite a
distance from the house. The farmer may either leave very early in the morning
or come back late in the evening or make it a weekly or even monthly trip to
the house. In this case, he constructs a set of huts where he, along with
members of his family and probably his laborers live. In the case of <i>oko-etile,
</i>the farmer goes to the farm early in the morning and go back home to have
his lunch; he may go back to the farm later in the evening to work. <i>Ogba </i>is
usually located in the outskirt of the town where the farmer can also go and
come back home. In most cases, vegetables are the main product. In the case of <i>Akuro</i>,
the farm is located near the bank of a river or a water logged area. The farmer
can plant any food-crop any time of the year since there is constant supply of
water but this is often used for vegetable farming. Those with large farms
enlist the services of their colleagues through <i>Owe</i> and <i>Aaro</i>.In
this case, other colleagues work for him on certain days and he only provides
them with foods and drinks. Farmers may also employ the services of paid
workers or <i>Alagbaro</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'>This type of
farming encourages men to be polygamous. The more wives and children they have,
the more hands that will  assist the farmers  with their work.If the man has
male children, they assist him with the farm, however, if he has female children,
it is incumbent on their husbands to assist their father in law. There is
division of labor between the husband and the wife or wives in the disposal of
the farm produce. While the husband produces the farm products, it is the
responsibility of the wife/wives to take these products to the market for sale,
the husband will then give them certain percentage depending on the sale. There
are two categories of farm products; these are cash crops and food crops. Examples
of cash crops include rubber, cocoa, kola nut, cotton, and so on, while example
of food crops include yam, cassava, maize, pepper, vegetables, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'><b>Hunting:</b>         Hunting
is another type of profession in Yoruba land. <i>Ogun</i> was regarded as the
first hunter. The profession is not just for anybody. Anybody going into it
must be generous, brave, must be able to endure, must be swift or slow as occasion
demands. A lot of training is required for would-be hunters. Training may take
up to five or more years to complete. It is usually very intensive. Part of the
training include among others, how to hibernate for animals, how to handle
various types of hunting implements, how to act and react in the bush to
various situations. Hunters are also expected to be versed in various types of
assorted traditional medicines like <i>egbe,</i> <i>afeeri, ajabo, idiwo</i>, and
so on. Any hunter without this entire juju must not venture into hunting
profession or else, he'll pay dearly with his life. Hunters are expected to
offer sacrifices after each hunting expedition, and particularly if they kill
certain types of animals. For instance, it is absolutely necessary for them to
offer sacrifices after killing elephants, buffalo, pythons, and other big
animals in this category. If any hunter defaults, the consequences, in most
cases, are disastrous. For instance, he may not kill any other animal for a
very long time or even again, he may have abnormal offspring or not even have
any. It is forbidden for hunters to cut corners with their colleagues for fear
of being strike to death by <i>Ogun</i>-the god of iron. Some of the don'ts of
hunters include the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'>Apart from
their profession, they also assist the community that they are in other ways.
For instance; they are used as night-watchmen against armed-robbers and night marauders.
They are used to check external aggression. They are the bedrock for the town's
army in case of war. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:-27.0pt;text-align:justify'><b>Cloth
weaving:          </b>This is another major type of profession in Yoruba land.
This is a male dominated job. The types of clothes that can be woven include
aso-ofi (of various types and shades like sanyan, alaaari, etu, dendelawo,
sanmo-nmi, etc) and kijipa. Before the coming of the Europeans, they have the
traditional weaving treads that are soaked in dyes depending on the color and
deepness of the dye required by the customers. But now they can purchase any
type of weaving tread in the market that has been made to specification. Some
of the traditional instruments used for cloth weaving include but are not
limited to the following, <i>kokogu, biribiri, oko, omu,</i> <i>asa/iwa, ese
ofi,</i> etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Yoruba
people, just like other races travel a lot. They can be seen in every nook and
cranny in the world, where they settle for one reason or another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Before
the advent of the various types of vehicles that we have now, it was reported
that people traveled on foot from one location to another. People traveled for
as many as 10 days or more before getting to their destinations. Before setting
out on the journey, they usually have some food with them. However, when the
food is finished, they find food to buy on the way. It was not the practice
then for sellers to be by their wares, they only have to indicate with signs
how much they are selling the goods. When travelers come across the food on
their way, they buy and leave the money by the wares. Truth and honesty was very
sacred then, as one cannot go away without paying for what one has bought. The
travelers are, in some cases, at the mercy of wild animals that they might encounter
on their way. In the same vein, those whom they left behind will only pray that
their wards/families come back in peace, it is only when they see them that
they know that they are alive. It is however their belief that whenever they
travel on a journey, and no matter how long they stay, they must go back home,
hence the adage, <i>ile labo sinmi oko</i> Ågit is home that one returns after a
sojourn in the farmÅh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Presently,
just like in most other parts of the world, there are so many means by which
people move from one place to another. Some of these include, bicycle,
motorcycle, various types and shades of motor vehicles, trains, trucks,
airplanes, and so on .Those who live beside big rivers, lagoon, or even sea,
have the opportunity to travel by water. In some parts of Yoruba too, they use
horses as a means of transportation. People seldom travel by foot nowadays. In
most of the towns and villages, the local government councils designate
particular points at which people going towards the same direction can board vehicles.
Each of these points or parks also has leaders who control the day to day
affairs of the parks. It is the duty of<i> agbero</i> ÅgconductorsÅh<b> </b>to
invite passengers to board vehicles. It is also their duty to collect exact
fares from the passengers when heÅfs sure that the vehicle is full. They then
hand over the takings to the driver when some deductions might have been
taking. Passengers who have excess luggage pay extra money to the driver.&nbsp;
Majority of these parks also have restaurants where the would-be travelers and
others eat before embarking on the journey. Also, one can get things to buy
like, bread, chin-chin, various types and shades of fruit drinks, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><i>Abeere
ona ki i sina</i> Åghe who ask for direction does not miss his wayÅh. This is a
popular adage in Yoruba to show that it is not something shameful to ask for
direction. At the other end, people are always magnanimous to show strangers
any directions they might be asking for. There are different locations that can
be reached at any point in time. These locations can equally be described to
any strangers going towards the place using any physical object within the
vicinity. Some of these objects include river, any spectacular structure or
building, tree, etc. At the end of this, they also have the confidence that as
long as people live there, they cannot miss their way.</p>

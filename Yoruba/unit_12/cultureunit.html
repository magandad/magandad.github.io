<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Yoruba people, just like other
races travel a lot. They can be seen in every nook and cranny in the world,
where they settle for one reason or another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Before the advent of the various
types of vehicles that we have now, it was reported that people traveled on
foot from one location to another. People traveled for as many as 10 days or
more before getting to their destinations. Before setting out on the journey,
they usually have some food with them. However, when the food is finished, they
find food to buy on the way. It was not the practice then for sellers to be by
their wares, they only have to indicate with signs how much they are selling
the goods. When travelers come across the food on their way, they buy and leave
the money by the wares. Truth and honesty was very sacred then, as one cannot
go away without paying for what one has bought. The travelers are, in some
cases, at the mercy of wild animals that they might encounter on their way. In
the same vein, those whom they left behind will only pray that their
wards/families come back in peace, it is only when they see them that they know
that they are alive. It is however their belief that whenever they travel on a
journey, and no matter how long they stay, they must go back home, hence the
adage, <i>ile labo sinmi oko</i> “it is home that one returns after a sojourn
in the farm”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='color:blue'>What
is the mode of traveling nowadays? </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Presently, just like in most
other parts of the world, there are so many means by which people move from one
place to another. Some of these include, bicycle, motorcycle, various types and
shades of motor vehicles, trains, trucks, airplanes, and so on .Those who live
beside big rivers, lagoon, or even sea, have the opportunity to travel by water.
In some parts of Yoruba too, they use horses as a means of transportation. People
seldom travel by foot nowadays. In most of the towns and villages, the local
government councils designate particular points at which people going towards
the same direction can board vehicles. Each of these points or parks also has
leaders who control the day to day affairs of the parks. It is the duty of<i>
agbero</i> “conductors”<b> </b>to invite passengers to board vehicles. It is
also their duty to collect exact fares from the passengers when he’s sure that
the vehicle is full. They then hand over the takings to the driver when some
deductions might have been taking. Passengers who have excess luggage pay extra
money to the driver.  Majority of these parks also have restaurants where the
would-be travelers and others eat before embarking on the journey. Also, one
can get things to buy like, bread, chin-chin, various types and shades of fruit
drinks, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='color:blue'>Asking
for directions</span></u></b><span style='color:blue'>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i>Abeere ona ki i sina</i> “he
who ask for direction does not miss his way”. This is a popular adage in Yoruba
to show that it is not something shameful to ask for direction. At the other
end, people are always magnanimous to show strangers any directions they might
be asking for. There are different locations that can be reached at any point
in time. These locations can equally be described to any strangers going
towards the place using any physical object within the vicinity. Some of these
objects include river, any spectacular structure or building, tree, etc. At the
end of this, they also have the confidence that as long as people live there,
they cannot miss their way.</p>

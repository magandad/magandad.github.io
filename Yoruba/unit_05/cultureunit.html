<p class=MsoBodyText><b><u><span style='color:blue'>Importance Haggling in the
Yoruba commercial area</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Unlike what we have in the departmental stores in the United States and most of the West, prices of goods are not fixed. Both the buyer and the
seller haggle by the process of Dutch action. The sellers upon citing a
prospective buyer beckon at him/her to her stall. The seller will briefly introduce
the product to the buyer and ask for the quantity he/she wants to buy. By this
time, the seller will give the buyer the price. This price, in most cases, is
as much as 200% of the price that will be agreed to later. Both the buyer and
the seller are usually skillful in the art of cutting down prices. The buyer
who is not good at driving bargains is strongly advised to enlist the services
of another because of the loss such an unskilled buyer is likely to incur. Male
buyers are not perceived as keen hagglers as female, although there are
exceptions to this. A hesitating or timid buyer may be accosted by two of more
sellers at the same time. But once he steps before one of them, however prolong
the haggling, the rival traders must make no attempt to invite him/her over to
their stalls. This skill is part of what is considered essential to survival in
the market and almost all commercial arenas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoSubtitle><b><span style='color:blue'>Buying and selling in the
local market</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Local markets in Yoruba land can be categorized into two.
First, we have those that are daily i.e., day-to-day buying and selling by the
people in the town or village. It is often situated in the center of the town.
We also have the second type, which is periodic. It is held at an interval of
four to nine days. It lasts for several hours from very early in the morning
till evening. While the former is meant primarily for the town’s people, the
latter is patronized by people from different towns and villages, far and near.
Products from these markets are far cheaper than in the daily markets. The
location of the market that is periodic is usually in the outskirt of the town
along the highway that links several towns and villages. The periodic market is
usually highly populated whenever it is in session. In these local markets, whether
daily or periodic, traders erect shed or hut as shelter from both the sun and
the rain, others may just expose their wares and products in the open. Traders
are departmentalized on the basis of the line of goods and products they sell.
This means that you are most likely to find sellers of yam in one area; likewise
fish sellers; pepper seller; meat sellers; and so on. This, we assume, has a
lot of advantages. First, it makes it convenient for buyers to choose the best
from so many varieties available in one place. It also gives the buyers a clear
direction rather than having to perambulate around the entire market before
getting what is needed. It also makes it difficult for the sellers to under cut
the buyers. However, the sellers of the same product can form a cartel and this
may frustrate a buyer. A lot of social negotiation is required of both the
seller and buyer. The sellers are organized into associations based on the
wares they sell. They regulate and look after the welfare of their members. They
also settle disputes between members and between members and buyers. The <i>Iyaloja
(female marker leader) or Babaloja (male market leader)</i> heads the local
market. He or she represents the entire market in the various traditional
systems of government.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><u><span style='color:blue'>Buying and selling food</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the case of buying and selling various types of food
and foodstuffs, there two sides to it. In the first instance, there are those
who sell raw food stuffs like beans, yam and yam flour, cassava flour, yam
tubers of various types, rice beans and so on. The sellers either buy in bags
and sell as wholesalers or sell in big bowls. The sellers have various smaller
bowls for measuring the various quantities the buyer wants. Both the buyer and
the seller engage in haggling through the process of Dutch auction too. In the
second instance, there are those who sell prepared and cooked food. They are
called <i>iya olounje</i>. The size of the stall that the <i>iya olounje</i>
uses depends on the capital invested in it and the volume of customers expected
to patronize her. Prices of food items are generally fixed but there are
provisions for the customer to request a particular amount of a type of food.
These two forms of buying and selling food and foodstuffs are dominated by
women although there are cases of men in the business too. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b><u><span style='color:blue'>Buying and selling modern
items</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Modern items include among other things, personal items,
clothing, and household materials. These are cases of sellers who have small
wares; hence they hawk these wares, which they place on their heads and move
from one place to another soliciting for customers. After the preliminaries of
haggling of the prices, the buyer may pay fully or part of the price and
request that the seller come some other time to collect the outstanding
payment. For those who have big stalls with many wares to sell, their
activities practically follow what we discuss above concerning buyers and
sellers at a local market. In addition to the selling and buying of modern
items, there are departmental stores that also sell modern items but which do
not permit the buyer to haggle on the fixed and often labeled prices. These are
not common among the Yoruba and are generally located in major cities and
patronized by ‘sophisticants’ with the financial ability. </p>

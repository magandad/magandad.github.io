<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Different rites of passage among
the Yoruba people are ceremoniously marked and it often involves the
participation of the extended family as well as the larger community. Whether
in the form of ceremonial revelry or somber observances, the numerous
ceremonies are part of the Yoruba culture. Many of these have become altered over
time but the core value of celebrating the different rites of passage in the
life of an individual and the community remains intact. Some of these
ceremonies include, but not limited to, <i>isomoloruko</i> ‘naming ceremony,’ <i>iwuye</i>
‘chieftaincy ceremony,’<i> igbeyawo</i> ‘marriage ceremony,’ <i>isinku</i>
‘funeral ceremony,’ <i>isile</i> ‘house-warming ceremony,’ <i>ijade oku</i> ‘remembrance
of departed souls,’ and many more. We will briefly consider aspects of three of
these ceremonies namely naming, wedding and burial ceremonies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Naming ceremony:    </b>Naming
a child is a serious business in Yoruba land. Its importance cannot be
overemphasized. This is because of their belief that any name given to a child
will ultimately affect him/her throughout the entire life. This, then, accounts
for the adage in Yoruba which says that <i><span lang=FR>Oruko</span>&#61475;</i><i><span
lang=FR> a maa roni</span></i>; <i>Àpeje</i><i><span lang=FR>&#61475;</span> a
sì maa ronìyan</i> meaning that a person’s name directs his actions and
behaviors. Therefore they tend to give names that will bring prosperity and
goodness to the child. After a child is born, the oracle is consulted to know
the future of the child. This will enable the parents know and monitor the
child’s career, marriage partner, travel, vocation and job, and any other plan.
The naming ceremony usually takes place after the 9th day if it’s a boy and if
it’s a girl it is 7th day. For a set of twins, it is usually on the 8th day. However,
with the advent and influence of Christianity and Islamic religions, naming
ceremonies now take place on the 8th day. It is usually early in the morning
with a lot people in attendance. These include the parents of the child, grand
parents, relations, neighbors, friends and well-wishers. During the ceremony,
the ancestral spirits are invoked for blessings. The items used include; native
gin and colanuts (used to invoke ancestral blessing for the child); salt and
honey (which symbolize sweetness of life); bitter cola (which symbolizes long
life); alligator pepper (which symbolizes countless number of children); cool
water in a bowl. Each of those present at the occasion will carry the baby and
then gives a name to it after putting money in a bowl of water. A child can
have as many names as those presents at the ceremony depending on their
perception of the circumstances that surround its birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>However, the child has at least
three different names which will guide the child through life. The first is
either an amutorunwa name (name brought from heaven) or an abiso name (name
given at birth). Secondly, there is the oriki (praise name) which expresses
what the child is or is hoped to become. Thirdly, the child has his/her orile
which is a name indicative of the child’s kinship group’s name. The choice of a
name depends on many factors such as time of day, a specific day, or a special
circumstance relating to the child, parents, extended family, or the whole community
which attends the child’s birth. Hence, the Yoruba proverb that says ile laa wo
ka to so omo loruko (the condition of the home determines a child’s name).The
amutorunwa is applied to all children born under like circumstances. The most
important of these is that of twin (ibeji) birth. The name of the first born of
twins will always be Taiwo (To-aye-wo ‘has the first taste of the world’). The
second born will be Kehende (‘he who lags behind’). Children born immediately
after twins, female or male, are named Idowu. Then we have Alaba. After Alaba
we then have the child called Oni (today) which from its birth cries
incessantly day and night. After Oni the next child will always be named Ola
(tomorrow) and the next will be Otunla (‘day after tomorrow) .We also have
names such as Ajayi ‘a baby born face downward’. Dada ‘a baby born with curly
hair’, Oke ‘a baby born with an unbroken umbilical cord.’ Ige ‘a baby that
comes out with its legs first.’ Ilori a baby conceived without previous
menstruation. Also babies born on special occasions are given special names.
Some of these include: Abiodun or Bodunde ‘a child born during any festival’.
Children born after the demise of the grandparents are called Babatunde or
Tunde (the father has returned) if they are male, and if they are female they
are called Yewande, Yetunde, Iyabode, Yeside ( all meaning ‘the mother has
returned’).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Names are also given depending on
the divinities the parents worshiped. Some of these include Ogun, Oya, Sango,
Ifa, Esu or even the vocation of the parents such as hunters (Odejide, Odetayo
etc.), drummers (Ayanyemi, Ayanwale),Names can also depend on the nature of
chieftaincy titles of the parents. We also another category of names called
Abiku (Born-to die).These are group of names which parents give those children
that die shortly after they are born. They are later born into the same family
as many times as they wish from the spirit world. Some of these include
Kokumo&#61475; (this child will not die again),   Koso&#61475;ko (there is no
more hoe to dig a grave), Àmbe&#61475;lo&#61475;run-(we are appealing to god
(to spare his life)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Wedding Ceremony:             </b>A
boy is considered ripe for marriage when he is about thirty years and a girl,
when she’s about twenty five years. It is an aberration to remain single for
life. Even when a man is known to be impotent, he gets married just to save his
face and that of his immediate families. Marriage is a family affair- between
the two families of both the boy and the girl. There are about six stages
involved in the marriage ceremony. These are time for searching, Ifa
consultation, releasing the voice, (isihun) engagement, idana, and the wedding
proper. Time for searching involve the period when both the groom-to-be search
for potential wife. There are usually common meeting points for the two of
them. These places include evening market square, along the farm, or where they
both fetch water. After the boy is satisfied the he has seen a beautiful girl,
he informs his father. His father will then inform the eldest member of the
family. When they are sure that there is no blood relationship between the two,
they then meet with the family of the bride-to-be. The two families then select
a go-between (Alarena).It is the duty of the Alarena to perform a background
check on the family of the bride-to-be. This is to avoid marrying someone with
some serious physical or mental disorder such as lunacy, epilepsy, leprosy, or
extreme albinism. The Alarena will also watch the conduct of the girl over
time. When she is satisfied with the conduct of the girl, the family of the boy
now consults the ifa oracle .The aim is to know what the future portends for
the two people involved. If the consultation yields a positive result, then
they move to the next stage, if not then they discontinue with the marriage.
The releasing of the voice (Isihun) is when the girl gives her consent in the
marriage. The date is now set for the Itoro (engagement).On the appointed day,
a few elders from the boy’s family gets to the girl’s house as early as five am
in the morning unannounced. This is to formally solicit for the parent of the
girl’s consent in marriage. The girl’s parent will then told the delegates that
they are not the only one involve in given out the girl. This is because
marriage involves every member of the extended family and no one must be left
uninformed. Before the delegation leaves, a date is set for Idana .On the appointed
day, the two families meet in bride-to-be’s residence.  This is when the dowry (owo
ori), and other items that have significance in the life of the family to be
are presented to the girl’s family. Some of the items include choice kola-nuts,
some alligator pepper, bitter-kola certain number of yam tubers, palm oil,
salt, fine wrapper of good quality, and other things. In most cases, the dowry
is returned to the parents of the boy with the assertion that they do not sell
their daughter. After much eating and drinking, the two families set a date for
the actual wedding. On the wedding day, there are so many festivities in both
the parents’ houses. The two families separately bring together and friends and
well-wishers. There is so much to eat and drink on this day. The two families
display the various uniforms (aso-ebi) which they have sown. Both the bride and
the groom’s families flaunt their affluence with the type of people in
attendance, the type of musician(s) invited, and duration of the parties.<b> </b>In
the night, the bride goes before the male elders of the family to obtain
blessing. The eldest of them starts the prayer asking the ancestors to protect
her. He also admonishes her to be of good conduct in her new abode. All other
male and later female members take their turn to pray for her and advise her.
After these prayers, she then turns to her mother for prayer and blessing in
form of bride’s song of departure (ekun iyawo).The bride is then taken to the
groom’s house by some men, accompany by some of the wife’s friends and a
younger cousin, niece or nephew who is known as omo iyawo. After all
formalities, at the entrance of the house, the bride is admitted into the
household and finally handed over to the eldest wife in the family for
mentoring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Greater importance is attached to
virginity of the girl among the Yoruba. The girl must be found to be virgo
intacta. If the reverse is the case on her first night, then she faces a
thorough beating the following day so as to confess the culprit. But if she’s
found to be a virgin, then the groom’s family will send some gifts to her house
the following day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Burial Ceremonies:               </b>Burial
ceremonies are as important as the other two ceremonies mentioned above. It is
the belief of the Yoruba that adequate and befitting burial must be given to
the dead. However, it is only the older people that are given these types of
befitting burials. There are many types of burials in the land. The type of
burial to be given depends, to a large extent, on the type of death, the age, or
the position of the dead in the society. The type of death include drowning,
falling off from the trees (in most cases palm trees), accidental shooting by a
fellow hunter, chiefs and kings, hunch backs, teenagers, etc. For the
teenagers, the death is regarded as something sorrowful, and something that
should not be prayed for, therefore, there’s no wining and dinning. The corpse is
buried by those younger than it. However, for those that are old, adequate
arrangements are made, just like the naming and marriage ceremonies, to
celebrate it. Traditionally, the dead are buried within the three days of their
death. However, with the advent of Christianity and modernity, corpses now stay
in the mortuary for as long as the relations want.<b> </b>Prior to this
contemporary period, the Yoruba do not bury their dead in the graveyard or
burial ground, but in their houses. Infants and teenagers are, however, buried
in the bush. Ground is dug within the courtyard, either within the room of the
dead or in the balcony. It is usually six feet long, the corpse is put in the
coffin and buried there.<b> </b>Funeral rites are conducted as appropriate on
either the third day or the seventh day. But the whole burial ceremony is
concluded on the fortieth day. During the final burial ceremony, all the
children and the extended family members invite friends, neighbors and
well-wisher to the ceremony and there’s considerable feasting. Musician(s) are
invited to play either for a short period or for the entire night. Uniforms
(aso-ebi) are worn during the celebration. In the course of the funeral rites,
all the male in-laws have very important roles to play. They are expected to
dig the grave of their father-in-laws. They are also expected to produce a goat
each for the rites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The Yoruba have appropriate
descriptions for the body parts. As with any other group of people, the different
parts of the body are variously and indigenously labeled. Some of these body
parts labels include: <i>ojú</i> (eye) that is used for sight (fún ríríran);
etí (ear) that is used for hearing (<i>fun gbígbóràn</i>); <i>enu</i> (mouth)
that is used for tasting (<i>fún títówò</i>) and speaking (<i>fún sísòrò</i>); <i>imú</i>
(nose) that is used for smelling (<i>fún gbígbóòórùn</i>); <i>owó</i> (hand)
for touching (<i>fún fífowókan nnkan</i>) and so on. The body can be divided
into four segments of the head (<i>orí</i>) including the neck (<i>orùn</i>);
the torso (<i>ara</i>); the arm (apá) from the shoulder (èjìká) to the fingers
(ìka owó); and the legs (esè) from the thighs (itan) to the foot (atelese). The
private parts and the left hand are the only body parts that are circuitously
labeled in Yoruba language. The vagina is known as <i>ojú-ara</i> (the eye of
the body) and penis is called <i>nnkan omokùnrin</i> (the man’s thing/tool). Despite
the fact that Yoruba acknowledged the role played by the left hand (<i>owó òsì</i>)
with the proverb<i> ‘fi otun we osi fi osi we otun ni owo fi n mo”</i> (that is,
hands become clean if you use both hands to wash each other), they often times
say that the left hand is less valuable, especially since it is the hand you
use to clean up in the restroom. They even consider it an insult if someone
offers them something with a left hand. All the parts of the body are believed
to serve significant and mostly indispensable functions. The Yoruba therefore
consider anyone that is deformed (slightly or considerably) as <i>aláàbò ara</i>.
Interestingly, the body parts also form the basis for the derivation of various
grammatical and idiomatic expressions in the Yoruba language. For example,
prepositional materials are derived from the combination of <i>ní</i> (at) with
a body part as in <i>lórí (</i>on that is derived from<i> ni + orí</i> at head)
and <i>léyìn (</i>behind that is derived from<i> ní + èyìn </i>at back). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>A unique component of
communication is the strong element of forthrightness with which the physical
description of different people is presented. People are described in relation
to their physical appearance whether they are tall or short, fat or slim. One
may be fat (<i>sanra) </i>or slim (<i>tín-ín-rín) </i>or tall<i> (ga) </i>or
short<i> (kúrú)</i>. In addition to making use of these descriptive terms candidly,
the Yoruba language also appellations that are used to refer to people with
some of these physical attributes. For example, a tall, thin or lanky individual
might be given the nickname, Opelenge or Alonge while a fairly fat or big  person
might be referred to as <i>Orobo.</i> Interestingly, the standard on beauty,
especially for females, among the Yoruba people is different from many other
parts of the world. Whereas, being skinny or slim is considered the beauty
standard in the West, being relatively big or being judged ‘plump’ is the
Yoruba standard. In actuality, being plump, especially in the case of Yoruba
men, is an indication of affluence or wealth while being relatively thin or
slim might be construed to mean that the person is impoverished or ‘living from
hand to mouth.’</p>

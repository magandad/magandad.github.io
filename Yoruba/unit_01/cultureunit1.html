</strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  It will be an understatement to say that the Yoruba cherished greetings
          so much. We can equally say that greetings are inseparable from the
          Yoruba
        because, this
    is the first thing a stranger will notice when he meets the Yoruba people.
        In fact, the Yoruba men and women rescued from slavery by the British
          warship and
    settled in Freetown in the present Republic of Sierra Leone at the beginning
    of 19th century were known and called &#8216;Aku&#8217; which is the prefix
    that is attached to all types of greetings in Yoruba. Greeting is a way of
    showing
    respect to each other .Not only between an elder and a younger one, but also
    between peers. A child an adult who wakes up in the morning, meet people
    on their way, and do not greet them is regarded as being untutored and without
    the required
    home training.<br>
  <br>
  There is also no hard and fast rule about who greet first. It is the first
    person to see that greets first; either young or old. However, when the younger
    ones
    are greeting the elders, the boys will prostrate- full stretch with their
    chests and chin on the ground while the girls will knee down with their two
    knees.
    They, then, greet as circumstance demands. They will be in the position until
    the elders
    complete their own part of the greetings. The process of the greeting can
    be between three to five minutes. It is forbidden for the younger ones to
    look
    into the eyes of the older ones in the process of greeting. While the younger
    ones
    are on their knees or prostrating (as the case may be) the elders will be
    saying all his/her oriki or praise and attributive names, both personal and
    family
    ones. It is also forbidden for the younger ones to say the oriki of the older
    ones.
    Within the family setting, both nuclear and extended, the Baale or family
    head wakes up very early in the morning and greet everybody within the compound.
    In the process of greeting, he mentions their names individually, no matter
    how
    young or old. In this process, he makes enquiry about the state of their
    health,
    work, and even progress. Since he is the Baale, he knows the oriki or praise
    and attributive names of everybody within the nuclear and extended family.
    As the greetings progress, he laced them with individual&#8217;s attributive and
    praise names. This early morning greetings are particularly important in the
    Yoruba setting. Any Baale that does not do this is regarded as irresponsible
    and ignoring his duty to his family members. This opportunity of early morning
    greetings is also used acquainting himself with state of affairs of everybody
    within his &#8216;community&#8217;.<br>
  <br>
  Greetings in Yoruba are countless. There is no occasion that does not have its
    distinct and peculiar greeting. For days and seasons, there are greetings for
    very early morning, morning, mid-day, afternoon, evening, night, and even mid-night.
    There are also special greetings for raining season, dry seasons, and different
    festivals when there is food drought and when there is plenty to eat.<br>
  <br>
  All occupations, trades, and professions have different greetings peculiar to
    each of them. Some of this include among others, barbers, palm wine- tapper,
    black smith, hunter, angler, carpenter, the diviner, hair- dresser, etc. In addition,
    different states of health have their own greetings. For instance, a person that
    is seriously ill has one, someone recuperating has too. The age the decease will
    also determine the type of greeting. For instance, there are different types
    of greetings for deaths that are considered premature and deaths that are considered
    to be matured. There is a type for greeting when one is embarking on a journey,
    another when you are right within the trip and another type upon arrival. There
    are separate greetings for barren women, expectant mother, immediately after
    delivery and in the process of breast feeding and weaning of the baby.<br>
  <br>
  As we have mentioned earlier, the Yoruba have greetings for all occasions and
    this is why the ethic group is peculiar in Africa. As can be seen from the
  above explanation on the type of greetings that we have among the Yoruba, every
  occasion
    of incident has its own different of peculiar type of greeting. This major
  trait distinguishes the ethnic group from others, even in Nigeria.<br>
  <br>
  Greeting is very vital to communication and community life in Yoruba because
    it acts as motivator of some sort. The absence of an appropriate greeting,
    whenever it is required can be the beginning of an age long hostility. For
    instance, if
    two people or even two families are at loggerhead on any issue, and they
    have stopped all forms of communications whatsoever, per adventure any one
    of them
    give birth, it is incumbent and mandatory for the other to greet him or her,
    just for the safe delivery of the baby, then the grudge and the hostility
    can continue. If he/she refuses to do so, it will be assumed that overtly
    or covertly,
    the other person or group has been planning something sinister for the expectant
    mother. This can further lead to full blown &#8216;war.&#8217;<br>
  <br>
  When one is receiving a guest, whether a stranger or someone that is known,
    one must treat the person &#8216;generously&#8217;. The content of the greeting
    may include questions about the trip, how stressful it is, the cost of transportation,
    how he/she is able to locate the house and so on. After all these salutations,
    the proper business of the visit will now commence. After the conclusion
    of the
    business and the guess is ready to leave, the host must see him/her off to
    the bus station with appropriate greetings.</font><br>

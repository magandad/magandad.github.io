<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The types of houses constructed
in Yoruba speaking areas are very peculiar and unique. There are no single
structure houses (Except, of course, those in cities and towns where we have
individual structures). Because of the communal nature of their lives, they
live in compounds called <i>Agbo-ile. </i>Agbo–ile is a collection of rooms or
apartments occupied by <i>ebi </i>who are related in one way or the other. The
ebi include everyone who can be traced to be related by blood, no matter how
far removed in time or space. What binds them together is blood relationship
which is regarded as stronger than any connection hence the proverb, <i>bintin
ni mo ba a tan</i> <i>ko se e fi obe bu.</i>  &quot;no matter how remote your
blood relationship is with someone, you cannot slice it with knife”. The compound
is circular in nature, with each entrance of the apartment leading to an open
verandah that joins every one of them together. At the center of the compound,
the rectangular space there is used for rearing domestic animals like sheep,
goats, and chickens. The space, however, diminishes as more people moves into
the compound to build houses. Each apartment consists of two or more rooms
depending on the number of members of each family. Where the husband has more
than one wife, each of them takes a room, the husband takes one and the
children take another room. The question of paying rent is very limited to the
towns and cities. The families extended open welcome to strangers who might
want to stay in the town for one reason or the other. They allow them to take
up residence in their compound. They even offer them farmlands to farm when the
need arises.  Bathrooms and toilets are however constructed outside the
compound. Since every family within the compound are related in one way or the
other, whatever any family has can be legitimately used by another family
within the same compound without any acrimony or malice, if the owner does not
need it. Although someone’s business is everybody’s business, there’s still a
level of semi-autonomy within the same compound. There’s the feeling of
solidarity amongst every member of the compound. There’s also mutual assistance
within them whenever the need arises. It must however be noted that the
structure of Oba’s palace is, in most cases, bigger than most compounds. Most
of the palaces have so many rooms that may not be known to an outsider.
However, there is usually a courtyard where the Oba sits in judgment whenever
there’s any dispute to be settled. The Oba might have another room or rooms for
receiving different categories of guests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='color:blue'>What
are the various types of communities and their structures?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The first type of community that
we have is the <i>agbo-ile</i>. Because they are related by blood in one way or
the other, the feeling of solidarity and intimacy develops amongst members of
the compound. Mutual assistance, in one form or another, goes on between them. It
is headed by the <i>Baale,</i> who is regarded as the father of the house. He
settles quarrels and both intra- and inter-family disputes within the community.
He possesses both judicial and legal autonomy in matters concerning members of
his compound. In Yoruba land, the compound is the most important primary group.
It can also be said to be the smallest political unit. The <i>Baale</i>
represent the entire compound in the comity of <i>Baale </i>within the <i>adugbo
</i>and/or<i> ilu</i> in matters concerning them. The next layer is the ward or
<i>adugbo</i>. It is a conglomeration of compounds and it is headed by a very
important chief who is called High Chief in most cases. He can be selected from
any of the compounds based on his past records of proven integrity, honesty,
hard work and dedication to the course of not only the various compounds but
also the town in general. He is the head of <i>Baale</i>-in-Council. He settles
any inter compound dispute and conflicts. He equally represents the entire
compounds within his domains in the town’s meetings. Most of the High Chiefs
form advisory committees of the king of the town. It must however, be noted
that some of these High Chiefs have the propensity of seceding if they feel
aggrieved on certain issues and with the full support and backing of their
people. They might even be lucky if there are any physical demarcations that
separate them from other wards. They now become distinct towns or villages.The
next layer is the town or village, as the case may be. (A town is bigger and
populous, with more facilities than a village.) If it is a town, it is headed
by the king or <i>Oba,</i> if it is a village; it is headed by the <i>Baale</i>.The
political system is monarchical and the system of succession is hereditary and
matrilineal. The office of the Oba is restricted to particular lineages that
are regarded as the ruling houses. They are mostly the founders of the town or village.
The Oba is the head of state and government. He is seen as the divine ruler who
has full power and control over the entire people in his domain, hence the
saying, <i>oba lo nile</i>, “the king owns the land”. Anything he says in the
land is incontrovertible, hence the saying, <i>alase, ekeji orisa</i>, “the
controller and second only to the gods”. The <i>Oba</i> is assisted, in his day
to day running of the affairs of the town, by the Council of Chiefs. Their
names range from <i>Balogun, Iyalaje, Apena, Parakoyi, Agbaakin, Asipa,</i>
etc.  Added to their functions, the Council of Chiefs, from time to time,
checks the powers of the Oba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u><span style='color:blue'>What
are the various types of social communities? </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The social organization form an
integral part of Yoruba and it is very much cherished and well respected. We
have the age grade social groups. These groups have various functions depending
on their ages. In most cases, people in age bracket of between 5-10 years are
grouped together. They perform such functions as clearing the roads within the
town/village and on the way to the farms or stream. They equally assist each
member of the group by going to the farm to help in clearing, planting or
harvesting. In the age group where we have able bodied men, they assist the
town whenever there’s any external aggression. They form the large chunk of the
army. Various trades also have their own associations. They moderate the
activities of their members and check their excesses in whatever forms. The
leader of the association is usually called Baba<i> egbe</i> or <i>Iya egbe</i>
depending on whether is a man or woman.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>The types of houses constructed in Yoruba speaking areas are
very peculiar and unique. There are no single structure houses (Except, of
course, those in cities and towns where we have individual structures).Because
of the communal nature of their lives, they live in compounds called <i>Agbo-ile.
</i>Agbo&#8211;ile is a collection of rooms or apartments occupied by <i>ebi </i>who
are related in one way or the other. The ebi include everyone who can be traced
to be related by blood, no matter how far removed in time or space. What binds
them together is blood relationship which is regarded as stronger than any
connection hence the proverb, <i>bintin ni mo ba a tan</i> <i>ko se e fi obe bu.</i>
&nbsp;&quot;no matter how remote your blood relationship is with someone, you
cannot slice it with knifeÅh. The compound is circular in nature, with each
entrance of the apartment leading to an open verandah that joins every one of
them together. At the center of the compound, the rectangular space there is
used for rearing domestic animals like sheep, goats, and chickens. The space,
however, diminishes as more people moves into the compound to build houses.
Each apartment consists of two or more rooms depending on the number of members
of each family. Where the husband has more than one wife, each of them takes a
room, the husband takes one and the children take another room. The question of
paying rent is very limited to the towns and cities. The families extended open
welcome to strangers who might want to stay in the town for one reason or the
other. They allow them to take up residence in their compound. They even offer
them farmlands to farm when the need arises. &nbsp;Bathrooms and toilets are
however constructed outside the compound. Since every family within the
compound are related in one way or the other, whatever any family has can be
legitimately used by another family within the same compound without any
acrimony or malice, if the owner does not need it. Although someoneÅfs business
is everybodyÅfs business, thereÅfs still a level of semi-autonomy within the same
compound. ThereÅfs the feeling of solidarity amongst every member of the
compound. ThereÅfs also mutual assistance within them whenever the need arises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>It must however be noted that the structure of ObaÅfs palace is,
in most cases, bigger than most compounds. Most of the palaces have so many
rooms that may not be known to an outsider. However, there is usually a
courtyard where the Oba sits in judgment whenever thereÅfs any dispute to be
settled. The Oba might have another room or rooms for receiving different
categories of guests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'><b><u>What are the various types of communities and their
structures that we have?</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'><b><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>The first type of community that we have is the <i>agbo-ile</i>.
Because they are related by blood in one way or the other, the feeling of
solidarity and intimacy develops amongst members of the compound. Mutual
assistance, in one form or another, goes on between them. It is headed by the <i>Baale,</i>
who is regarded as the father of the house. He settles quarrels and both intra-
and inter-family disputes within the community. He possesses both judicial and
legal autonomy in matters concerning members of his compound. In Yoruba land,
the compound is the most important primary group. It can also be said to be the
smallest political unit. The <i>Baale</i> represent the entire compound in the
comity of <i>Baale </i>within the <i>adugbo </i>and/or<i> ilu</i> in matters
concerning them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>The next layer is the ward or <i>adugbo</i>. It is a
conglomeration of compounds and it is headed by a very important chief who is called
High Chief in most cases. He can be selected from any of the compounds based on
his past records of proven integrity, honesty, hard work and dedication to the
course of not only the various compounds but also the town in general. He is
the head of <i>Baale</i>-in-Council. He settles any inter compound dispute and
conflicts. He equally represents the entire compounds within his domains in the
townÅfs meetings. Most of the High Chiefs form advisory committees of the king
of the town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>It must however, be noted that some of these High Chiefs have
the propensity of seceding if they feel aggrieved on certain issues and with the
full support and backing of their people. They might even be lucky if there are
any physical demarcations that separate them from other wards. They now become
distinct towns or villages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>The next layer is the town or village, as the case may be. (A
town is bigger and populous, with more facilities than a village.) If it is a
town, it is headed by the king or <i>Oba,</i> if it is a village; it is headed
by the <i>Baale</i>.The political system is monarchical and the system of
succession is hereditary and matrilineal. The office of the Oba is restricted
to particular lineages that are regarded as the ruling houses. They are mostly
the founders of the town or village. The Oba is the head of state and government.
He is seen as the divine ruler who has full power and control over the entire
people in his domain, hence the saying, <i>oba lo nile</i>, Ågthe king owns the
landÅh. Anything he says in the land is incontrovertible, hence the saying, <i>alase,
ekeji orisa</i>, Ågthe controller and second only to the godsÅh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>The <i>Oba</i> is assisted, in his day to day running of the
affairs of the town, by the Council of Chiefs. Their names range from <i>Balogun,
Iyalaje, Apena, Parakoyi, Agbaakin, Asipa,</i> etc. &nbsp;Added to their
functions, the Council of Chiefs, from time to time, checks the powers of the
Oba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>The social organization form an integral part of Yoruba and
it is very much cherished and well respected. We have the age grade social
groups. These groups have various functions depending on their ages. In most
cases, people in age bracket of between 5-10 years are grouped together. They
perform such functions as clearing the roads within the town/village and on the
way to the farms or stream. They equally assist each member of the group by
going to the farm to help in clearing, planting or harvesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>&nbsp;In the age group where we have able bodied men, they
assist the town whenever thereÅfs any external aggression. They form the large
chunk of the army.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%'>Various trades also have their own associations. They
moderate the activities of their members and check their excesses in whatever
forms. The leader of the association is usually called Baba<i> egbe</i> or <i>Iya
egbe</i> depending on whether is a man or woman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

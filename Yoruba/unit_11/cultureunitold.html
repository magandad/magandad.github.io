      Telling Time<br>
      </strong><br>
  Before the advent of the Europeans with the introduction of modern clocks, the
  Yoruba had their own way of knowing and telling time. The sun, the moon and the
  crow of cocks play important roles in telling the time. While the sun tells the
  time in the mid morning and afternoon, the moon tells the time in the evening
  and mid-night. Lastly, the crowing of the cocks tells the time very early in
  the morning. In the case of the sun, the shadow of reflection of an individual
  standing of sitting or even a building or tree in the afternoon will indicate
  a particular time of the day. Also, the position or the size of the moon indicates
  a particular time of the night. In the case of the crowing of the cocks, the
  Yoruba know that the first time the cock crows is a few hours till sunset, likely
  to be around 3.30am today. By the time it crows the third time, people will be
  ready to go out. However, with the advent of and introduction of clocks by the
  European explorers and missionaries, the Yoruba now rely heavily on watches and
  clocks; though the older generations living in the country sides and many who
  are uneducated still rely on these traditional ways mentioned above. Even in
  adapting the modern system of telling time, the Yoruba people have developed
  their own system of telling time in the language. </font> </div>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Days, Months and Years </font></strong><br>
        <br>
        <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Yoruba people have many deities that are worshipped and each of these
          deities is associated with each day. In most cases, these days and
          months are referred to by the names of these deities worshipped on
          these days. For the days of the week, their names reveal some of Yoruba
      beliefs and worldview:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ojo aiku&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; ‘day
          of immortality’ Sunday	favorable day for major life events <br>
  ojo aje&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  ‘day of profit’	Monday	favorable
  for commerce<br>
  ojo isegun &nbsp; ‘day of victory’	Tuesday	favorable day for journeys etc.<br>
  ojo ru&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 	‘day of sacrifice’	Wednesday
  unfavorable for major life events<br>
  ojo bo&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 	‘day of new creation’	Thursday
  favorable day for major life events<br>
  ojo eti&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  ‘day of deadlock’ Friday	considered
  a day of difficulties<br>
        ojo abameta ‘day of three motions’ Saturday considered a day of great
        indecisiveness</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are not certain how the names of months are derived in Yoruba. All
        that we know is that to determine the number of month in a year, the
        Yoruba of pre-colonial age counted the moon. These months are more important
        to farmers and traditional religion practitioners. This is why the months
        are named after some deities and types of farming. Each month is peculiar
        and associated with certain favorable and unfavorable beliefs. The Yoruba
        of pre-literate society relied heavily on oral history to tell the year.
        With this in mind, years are counted and measured and by important incidents
        like battles and wars fought by the people, famine, births or deaths
        of important dignitaries in the society, coronation of chiefs and kings
        and even visits of important personalities to the area, all tell the
        years.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Periods in the day (and in a person’s life)</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The day is divided into parts which helps the Yoruba people, even in
        traditional societies, to structure their daily existence. There are
        several parts to the day. Idaji or afejumo is the dawn; owuro or aaro
        is morning; iyaleta is mid day; osan is the afternoon; irole is evening/dusk
        which, traditionally, marks the end of the work day; ale is night time
        following dusk; and oru is middle of the night when everyone is presumed
        sleeping. The Yoruba associate time in the life of an individual with
        developmental growth corresponding to the progression of time in a day.
        They also believe that one must ‘wake-up’ in life and do things that
        must be done at the appropriate time. For instance, when an individual
        is old enough to own a farmland, he must be given one by his father or
        by the Olori-ebi (Family head). When he/she is old enough to get marry
        just like his peers, he/she must not tarry or else, people around him
        will call him to a meeting and tell him/her in a subtle way through proverbs
        and wise saying. Particularly, they believe that one must work hard when
        one is young and that in one’s old age or ojo ale, one must sit down
        to enjoy all that one has labored for in life. Anybody, for whatsoever
        reason, still works when he/she is old and in the ale of their life is
        not favorably viewed in the society at all. </font></p>
      <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Periods/Seasons in the Year</font></strong><br>
        <br>
        <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to our climatic conditions, the Yoruba experience two seasons
          in a year. These are the dry and the raining seasons. There is almost
          equal division of the day into periods of sunlight and darkness. On
          the average day, there is tropical sunlight between 10.00am and 4.00pm.
          Both the dry and the raining seasons are ushered in by thunderstorms
          and tornadoes; those preceding the raining season are often very violent.
          Tall trees are uprooted and roofs of buildings are blown away. Heavy
          rainfall is experienced during the months of April, May, June and July.
          There is usually a short dry season or what is referred to as ‘August
          break’ in the month of August and very early September. Heavy rainfall
          continues in September till early November when the dry season sets
          in. During the harmattan period, which is usually between the end of
          November and early January, the night temperature gets to its lowest
          point, while there is intense heat during the day. The period of the
          raining season is used for planting all the food crops. The early part
          of the dry season is used to harvest all the food crops and keep them
          in the barn. The remaining part is used to prepare again for the next
          farming season. This is the most appropriate period for building houses.
          The grasses that are used for constructions are harvested at this period. </font><br>

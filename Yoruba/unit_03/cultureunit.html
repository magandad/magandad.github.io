<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:blue'>How is the
Yoruba family unique?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Yoruba have a family structure, which is very
unique. It is unique in the sense that it is community based and a form of
grass root ‘government’. It is upon this grass root government that other tiers
of governments within the society are built. There are two levels of family
organization among the Yoruba people, the immediate or nuclear family level and
the kinship or extended family level. These two levels highlight both blood and
marital relationships. However, customarily, the most important and highly
highlighted familial relationships are along blood lines. Yoruba families are
customarily patrilineal and patrilocal in nature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:blue'>What
constitutes the nuclear family and the roles of members in it?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The nuclear family consists of the father or <i>baba</i>,
mother or <i>mama/Iya</i> and the children or <i>omo. </i>Polygamy is practiced
among the Yoruba, men can marry more than one wife. Both the wives and the half
brothers/sisters or <i>Obakan </i>in a polygamous family still constitute parts
of the nuclear family. It is the duty of the father to fend for the entire family
and especially the children. He provides for all their needs. The traditional
Yoruba society is agrarian in nature, the children learn how to farm until they
are mature enough to have their own separate portion of land. In the
alternative, the father may look for appropriate trade or vocation for them.
The boys get their liberty when they are married and start their own
independent lives but within the same compound. The girls, on the other hand
are married out into other families. The mother serves as the main ‘operation
manager’ within the nuclear family. She is a wife, a mother and the
administrator of the household economy. She contributes to the farm work,
caters to the need of the family and is generally responsible for nurturing and
directly molding the character of the children, especially the girls. In old age,
children are expected to take absolute care of the parents by providing for all
their needs. <i>Bí òkété bá dàgbà, omú omo rè ni i mu </i>‘when the bush rat is
advanced in age, it depends on its child’s breast milk for survival.’ </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:blue'>What
constitutes the extended family system?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The extended family system is another layer of
structure higher than the nuclear. Members of the extended family usually live
in a large compound (a round structure with a court –yard at the center). It
consists of as many nuclear families as they can have within the compound. They
live a community based live. The <i>agboole</i> or <i>agbo ile</i> or family
compound is headed by the <i>baale </i>or head of the family. He is the
representative of the entire extended family in the village or town council. He
acts as the caretaker of the family properties and also ensures that the burial
ground or <i>oju-oori </i>of his predecessors  are well taken care of. He makes
sure that the family deities are worshipped as at when due. He ensures that
there is peace and tranquility within the <i>ebi </i>or family by settling all
scores and disputes that may arise. He is the custodian of (the) family
tradition and knowledge. He may not necessarily be the richest among the men within
the extended family but he is the oldest. Whenever he dies, the title is not
given to his son or <i>aremo, </i>but it is given to the eldest living male within
the family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The <i>baale </i>is also supported by <i>Iyoaale </i>or
<i>iya kaa </i> who is the overall  head of all the women within the extended
family. She is usually the oldest amongst the women folks. She distributes and
apportions duties to other women within the family. She also settles disputes
amongst women. Whenever there are functions or ceremony within the <i>agbo-ile</i>,
she co-ordinates the cooking and serving of food. She assists the <i>baale</i>
in the day-to-day running of the <i>agbo-ile</i>. In most cases, when other
women go out everyday to buy and / or sell; they all leave their children with
her and she acts as the nanny for the <i>agbo-ile.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The entire members within the compound live a communal
life. Someone’s business is everybody’s business. Whenever anybody has anything
to do or he’s affected by anything, the entire family or <i>ebi</i> rally round
him / her. As occasion demands, the entire extended family wears the same type
of dress, shoe, cap and tie to match or <i>aso-ebi</i> if one of them is
celebrating any event.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Elders behave to the children within the compound
equally without discrimination. The younger ones also respect the elders
accordingly. The entire families are bound together by family ties or <i>alajobi
</i>and nobody dares to go against the norms and values of the family. Anybody
that does this, the spirit of their forefathers or <i>oku-orun </i>are invoked
and the consequences may be calamitous for such individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Yoruba cherished family tiers so much. They
believe that anyone with whom they have blood relations within the extended
family is of the same father and mother. They have just five words with which
they show family relationships. These are:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Baba</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>                –
         Father                          <i>Aburo</i>  -           Junior </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Iya/ Mama</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>       -           Mother                                    <i>Omo</i>
   -           Child</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Egbon              -           Senior </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>There isn’t much ambiguity about these kinship terms
and their usage. Any man within the extended family who is probably old enough
to be one’s father is regarded as <i>baba</i> or father; likewise, any woman
who is old enough to be one’s mother is regarded as <i>Iya/mama</i> or mother.
Any man or woman who is older than someone but not enough to be one’s father or
mother is regarded as <i>egbon </i>or senior. Likewise, anybody within the
family that is junior to someone is regarded as <i>aburo </i>or junior. All
within the family that are likely to be old or less than one’s son or daughter
are regarded as <i>omo </i>or child; Yoruba culture abhors  the use of the
following phrases:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Whenever they are used, they are interpreted to mean
that the speaker is overtly expressing the wish to distance himself/herself
from the addressees. It is a subtle denial of any intimate relationship. The
implication of the usage is that it invariably causes a breakdown of harmonious
relationship within the family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>These terms, along with references to vocation, residence
(if the person in question resides outside the compound) and so on, can also be
used to identify the many different <i>baba</i> and<i> iya</i> that a person
has within the extended family. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Marriage is a family affair in Yoruba land. Even though,
the boys may approach and woo any girl of their choice, it is the father and
other men within the extended family that will go to the girl’s house to seek
her hand in marriage from her parent. Consequently, marriage is considered a
bond between two families <i>‘idana’ </i>and not just between the <i>oko </i>husband
and <i>iyawo/aya</i> wife. The families that are united become <i>ana</i> or
in-laws which is another cherished relationship within Yoruba society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:blue'>How is
polygamy practiced?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The custom of ‘one man, many wives’ is both
traditionally and contemporarily acceptable among the Yoruba people. The
practice of polygamy allows men to marry more than one woman. However, men
marry as many wives as their financial capacity can allow. Some marry two,
three, six, eight or even more. It is a welcome development. In certain places
within the Yoruba society, the man’s affluence, wealth and even popularity are
measured based on the number of wives and children he has. The wives or <i>orogun
</i>live harmoniously within the same compound. They behave as sisters. Although,
there are cases in which the wives or <i>orogun </i>are always at loggerheads
even on trivial issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Within the family at large, elders do not joke with
their first wife or <i>iyaale.</i> The first wife or <i>iyaale </i>is very
powerful. It is her duty to apportion duties (such as sweeping and general
cleaning of the compound, fetching of water for the entire family, fetching of
firewood and other household duties) to other wives and to ensure compliance.
She even prepares a roaster the order in which the husband would “visit” with
each wife. She disciplines any erring wife either by banning their husband from
her room for a certain period or by other forms of punishment. The <i>iyaale</i>
takes charge of all the children to the extent of breast-feeding the toddlers
of other younger wives in their absence. All the children also eat with her from
the same plate. It is a taboo for younger wives to call the children born
before they are married into the family by their first names. All they do is to
create pet names like <i>Ajisafe </i>“one who wakes up to socialize stylishly’;
<i>Alaran </i>‘the owner of velvet cloth’; <i>Eyinfunjowo </i>‘teeth whiter
than money (silver coins)’; <i>Akowe </i> ‘the town clerk’; <i>Idi-ileke </i>‘the
waist for coral beads ornamentation’;  <i>Ibadi-aran </i> ‘the buttocks of
velvet or for velvet clothing; <i>Ayiluko </i>‘the plumpy/rotund one who rolls
into her husband in bed’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>If the husband dies, his younger brother or <i>baba
kekere </i>has the right to re-marry any of the brother’s wives he so wishes.
This is known as <i>opo-sisu. </i>It is a taboo for the senior brother or <i>baba
agba </i>to re-marry any of his deceased junior brother’s wives. The option is available
for the wives not to re-marry.  Some wives may not bear re-marrying their
husband’s junior brother, hence they go back to their parents’ house. Women can
also go back to their parent’s house if they divorce or if they are from the
royal family, they, thus, became <i>omo-osu </i> in their house. However, if
the women re-marry outside her former husband’s domain for any reason and have
children, these children or half brothers / sisters are <i>iyekan.</i></span></p>
